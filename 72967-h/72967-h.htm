<p>Dear Father:</p>

<p>A weakness we have long shared, and nurtured
together: our hankering after good mystery
stories. We have opened many a volume
that promised luridly—and failed to keep its
promise. And whenever we did find a passable
tale, our best pleasure in it was to pass it on to
the other. In these exchanges, I have learned that
you are more critical than I: so that as ever, in
bringing you this book, I do so timidly. If it
please you, I shall not need to worry about its
other readers.</p>

<p>I can foretell certain of your observations.
“Chalk Face” may seem to you at least as much
a Parable as a mystery story. But what indeed
is the difference between them? What more lurid
than the depths of desire, what more mysterious
than the hinterlands of conscience? And what
event is so great a mystery as life itself? I believe
that every tale should be a mystery tale. I
believe that the only stories that are not mystery
stories are the shallow stories.... Howsoever,
if you find in this book elements of moral and of
wonder usually absent from tales of crime, these
are ancestral traits which I have straight from
you. So, in the impulse making me write my story
as in the consequence, you have your share—and
you must be indulgent.</p>

<p><i>The man who writes the story of his life
begins by trying to justify his impulse. But
justification masks the true desire; and the
sincerest confessions often start with falsehood.
I could invent a reason for these pages,
easily and plausibly enough. I could say, being
a man of science and having failed in my
elected sphere, that with my story I shall make
amends: give to the world a document whose
revelation may mean far more to it than any
alienist’s career. This statement would perhaps
be truth. My tale will add to that
source of knowledge beyond the axioms of rational
science from which to-morrow the true
science of man may spring. But this statement
would not be the truth: it would not
express the extent nor the inwardness of my
impulse in writing. For I am moved by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
will far warmer than any altruism. I write,
first of all, for myself.</i></p>

<p><i>In setting down a record of my terrible adventure,
I hope to escape (for brief and precious
hours) from this eternal Twilight. I shall
dwell once more in the innocent world of men:
in the world where the sun is luminous because
the night is black, where life seems good because
death seems real. Let me not dwell upon
the nature of this Twilight. It is neither darkness
nor brightness, neither warmth nor cold.
It is penetrant and it is hungry, and it devours
the flesh of man that is made of sunnier senses.
You who read do not know the blessed marriage
of your world. You do not know that
sun is sweet to you, because you are sun: that
your five senses catching to your mind the
rounded beauty of nature and of love bring
but fond reflections ... stars, fair women,
mountains ... of yourself.</i></p>

<p><i>There is a Truth in which the sun burns up
as swiftly as your flesh. All is gone here; and
in this thundering silence the march of man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
that to you seems so bloody, to me has the
cadence of a quiet song. Man is born into
his mother’s arms, and belief cradles him. That
breast and that milk are real, for they are part
of himself. The day is real and the night,
work and reward are real, love is real: pain
is real because the need of victory is real.
What blessedness! Man is complete in his
flesh because no form, no thought comes to his
mind that is not portion of his flesh. He loves
his flesh in the sun and calls it God: he loves
his flesh in a woman and calls it Love. He is
all simple and whole: only his words, like in
a child’s game, break his unitary world. But
where I am, the flesh is not gone: it has become
a fragment of a truth vastly beyond it. This
is agony, and from this I seek respite.</i></p>

<p><i>I want once more to see the sun as you do:
to feel the earth solid and absolute beneath my
purposeful feet. I want to live again in your
commanding passions: loyalty, wonder, anger,
worship, love. What joy to be able to say:
“This is my friend,” “This is my work,” “This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
is my sweetheart,” “This is my faith.” What
common joy for you! Is it not worth what
you call pain to have it? Is it not worth what
you call death to have life?</i></p>

<p><i>For me, pain and joy, love and hate, heaven
and earth, life and time and death have dimmed.
They are all words of mortal flesh, expressive
of flesh’s elemental moods. Outside the flesh,
they have no meaning. My flesh is broken up
but it is not yet gone; so that its word and
will still speak to me ... fragmentarily, nostalgic
... of its departed day. I tell my story
to bring its wholeness back.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;AM John Mark, M.D. I title myself
so, even in my dreams: for it is a new
title and for long it was dream. I
worked hard for it. I do not want you to
think that I am dull, so that the winning of
that not rare degree was difficult. No: I am
above the average in intelligence—but in ambition
also. Even as a student I did not aim
at becoming a mere doctor. John Mark, M.D.,
was to have a higher connotation. It was
to stand not for the usual empiric healer: but
for the leader, for the creator. I am on the
way.</p>

<p>I am twenty-eight, and a citizen of New
York, where I was born and where my mother
was born: my father is of an old family from
Vermont. For three years upon a small income
inherited from my mother’s father, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
studied in Vienna, in Zurich, in Paris, in Saint
Petersburg. What there was of theory to learn
in my especial field I learned with ease and
no great exhilaration. (It was little, after all.)
What inspired and nurtured me was the personal
contact of half a dozen men, masters
whom I had read and reverenced for years
from a humble distance. They received me:
they showed interest in my work. They came
to look upon me, subtly I felt this, as a potential
equal. And I, harvesting the ripe treasure
of their science, grew to recognize that
their superiority was not one of stuff or spirit,
but of years and labor. I found that my own
impulse was very close to theirs: my power
to abstract phenomenal data equally intense:
my capacity to associate my findings, to link
them up and to transcend them in intuitional
concepts possibly as great. I was no epigone
to these masters. They learned that they could
speak with me in that shorthand of intimate
understanding which is the one articulate language.
I was one of them: part of their fuller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
to-morrow! I came back to my city,
glowing.</p>

<p>And almost at once I attained the post I
needed at the Institute. The Laboratory was
mine: I stood at a delicious dawn of intellectual
action: I tasted the ecstasy of the hour
in which my will and the world’s will, my
means and the world’s tools seemed one.</p>

<p>My salary scarce paid the rent of a snug
two-room flat. But my little income met the
rest of my needs. I asked nothing of my
father who was rich, and he asked nothing of
me. Books were my one extravagance—Gothic
tomes and palimpsests where mediæval mystics
had imposed their swelling dreams upon
the flat clarities of Rome. I knew myself for
a sociable and a sensual man. But my work,
like an expanding empire, had gradually absorbed
the time and energy whereby youth
spreads itself. The companionship of a few
men, students like myself or masters as I
meant to be a master, gave me a deeper satisfaction
than the common social fare. And although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
my desire for woman was great, it was
painfully involved with my intelligence and
with the difficult measure of my nerves. I was
less drawn by the sweet flesh than repelled by
the dullness and unchastity of women.</p>

<p>Indeed, for five years I had lived without
women altogether—almost without casual intercourse
of any kind. From month to month
I saw my parents. From hour to hour I dwelt
within my work: finding it a realm so various
that no mood of my waking and no dream
of my sleep were quite outside it. The delights
of leisure are those of wandering and surprise
and repetition. In my work I had them. Easy
love and comradeship bring ecstasy, because
in their otherness we lose ourselves, with passion
or with service. My work possessed these
qualities as well. I was as full in its embrace
as any woman in a happy love. And beyond
all fulfillment, I had the joy of tempering my
desire.</p>

<p>My work was indeed limitless: I looked on
my good mood as limitless, also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>

<h3><i>b</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT mood is behind me in this April
dusk, as I walk through the city streets
to dine with my parents. Behind me, in the
sense of a wide illusion hiding the sun of reality
like mist, and by the sun wiped out. I
have still my work: I enter still this inexhaustible
day of discovery and thought. But I
have found a woman whom I love! And in
my love for her, I understand the years of
continence and solitude: they were preparation
for this love; they were the articulate presentiment
that I would love indeed; they were a
threshold, in passionate void, for this great filling
passion.</p>

<p>I have been repelled by the unchastity of
women ... now it is clear! ... because I
looked and longed for a woman who was
chaste. I refer not to prostitutes. Indeed, a
low chastity is at times the one quality they
possess. Prostitutes did not repel, they bored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
me: they are impersonal, domesticated creatures,
like certain dogs in whom the individual
will has been displaced by the alien will of
man. Their one offering ... relaxation
... I had not aged enough to welcome. No:
it was women of my own world whom I found
unchaste. And now I understand, thinking of
Mildred, by what previsioned measure I had
mysteriously judged them.</p>

<p>... The girls toward whom I was drawn
by a clear physical desire and whose response,
that should have been as limpid, was confused
by fear of the Morrow and the Moral. The
married women whose lush fields invited pleasaunce,
and whose unchastity was still more
complex. For in them, the passional was entered
and deformed by the possessive; a chaos
of morals, poesy and economics weeded their
warm beauty. I was attracted, when at all,
to sensuous women. And sensuousness that
is not sheer becomes a tepid water: weak idealizing,
smug and slavish exaltation of the ego
muddies it. Such had been my conclusions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
measured, though I knew it not, by the revelation
that I was awaiting.</p>

<p>Now she is there—fulfilling all my world
whose unfulfillment I had sensed, not consciously,
but as a larva longs for its own birth.
I have loved my work, like a woman, because
I knew that there should come a woman
worthy of my work. I have been faithful to
my work, in faith of this woman who was to
come to crown it; who was to come, in spirit
and in flesh, to equal its high dream. Unwitting
I have labored in a dream: and behold,
it is fecund of this fleshed perfection: Mildred
chaste as thought, Mildred deep as discovery,
Mildred remote and imminent as truth!</p>

<p>I have met her: and although my continence,
my solitude and my devotion were a pæan of
my prescience, yet she exceeds them as the
flaming day the chill night’s sleepy vision of
the dawn. I have loved her. But on the sacrament
of winning her and making her love me,
I have not yet entered.</p>

<p>I come this evening to my parents, illumined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
in my love and in my knowledge that after
dinner I shall see her ... whatever happens
here, soon I shall be with Mildred: and I come
also tense with resolution, dark in a presentiment
of its failure. I want this very night to
speak to Mildred: I want to propose our marriage.
How can I do this with my pittance
of salary and income? I have resolved to ask
my parents’ help.</p>

<p>“Can’t we dine up here?” I say, as I meet
them in their drawing-room at the hotel. “I
want to speak seriously with you of a serious
matter. Downstairs in the dining-room, it
would be hard.”</p>

<p>I see my mother’s face and I know her intuition:
“My son is in love.” And I understand,
by looking at her face, the gloom that has
dwelt with my glow upon this undertaking.</p>

<p>My mother is tall. She is going to a theater
and she is dressed in a simple gown of jet
and lace from which her blonde hair and her
strong clear features rise in a beauty that is
almost stern. My mother loves me and does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
not want me to marry. She would buy my
dependence on her with all her fortune, if
she knew how. But she does not know how.
Her love has become that most sensual and
most possessive of all passions: an abstract
love, a love that by no living deed, no contact
of service, no exchange of will, reaches the
world of spirit. She begrudges me no fame,
no luxury, no vice. She asks of me no hours
and no secrets. Her place in my life, since
my life to her is an aura of her own, is secure
so long as no one filling it destroys it.</p>

<p>“Of course we can dine here. Clayton, will
you ring for the waiter?”</p>

<p>She is silent, incurious, decorous: knowing
already and asking of me no question.</p>

<p>How against her will that mothered mine
can I be eloquent for her enemy?</p>

<p>My cause is good. I have propounded subtler
and more recondite problems. I am
twenty-eight. With a power that is rare I
have excluded from my life all the warm nurtures
of friendship and of love. My needs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
have not died; it is as if they have in my austere
years gone forth from me and gathered to
one mastering presence: Mildred. When I
saw her so it was with me. Every sense, long
denied, called for her: every need of my body
and my soul, as waking from a trance, fused
in a single passionate direction: moving toward
Mildred, drawing Mildred to me. But my
work is not the sort that the world pays for.
That is no reason to abandon it. I cannot
bring to Mildred a man wrecked of his place
in the world. It is John Mark, scientist, who
needs her. It is Mildred Fayn, as she lives
now in her high artistry of leisure, whom I
need. I cannot make of her splendor a cook or
a drudge. Nor can I live with her splendor as
she must be lived with, outside of my career of
pure abstracted thought.</p>

<p>How clear it is! and how awkwardly I
speak! this evening at table with my parents.
I had despaired before I began. Why did
I come? What else was there to do?</p>

<p>Their refusal was as vague as my pleading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
for what my mind knew as the crucial cause
of my life. Even as I spoke, I criticized and
marveled at my weakness.—What is the matter
with you? You don’t lack persuasion, nor
power, nor weight of will. For a hundred
lesser causes you have done hundredfold better.
What is the matter?...</p>

<p>Mother put me off.</p>

<p>“Dear, there’s no hurry,” she said. “Wait
and see. You’re at the beginning of your
career. Don’t you need all your energy for
that? If Miss Fayn is truly the woman you
should have, she’ll wait for you: she’ll give up
a few fur coats to have you.”</p>

<p>Her black eyes blazed. In them I saw:</p>

<p>“If I had you really—you, my boy and my
body!—I should be happy, living in a kitchen.”</p>

<p>But her mind and her senses were, each, the
slave of the other. Her senses did not dare to
be happy. In all her life, she had foregone
the arduous and heroic way of happiness. So
now, she suppressed her avowal. She knew
nothing about it. But for this intimate death,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
she prepared to take revenge on her son whom
she loved, and on her son’s loved woman.</p>

<p>My father lighted his cigar, and as usual
sagged into the ease of his wife’s will.</p>

<p>“I put you through eight years of college,”
he began. He examined his Corona. He moistened
a finger and applied it to a crack in the
rich black leaf. “Some day you’ll get all we
have. If you want some cash—up to five thousand—it’s
yours. What more have you got the
right to ask? If you marry, like every other
married man, you got to look out for yourself.”
He puffed slowly: more rapidly, as a
thought at last came to his assistance. “I
suppose your mother and I should move to a
shoddy flat, so you and Harry Fayn’s daughter
can live in a swell one? You’ll buy our
motor, I guess?... Why, when I was your
age, my father——”</p>

<p>I did not argue. I did not point out to him
the false exaggeration of his picture. I did
not show him that at my age his work had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
been to help his father invest his money so
that neither of them should ever need to use
their minds: that indeed neither of them had
ever used their minds, and that the fair consequence
had been ... so far beyond the
ugliness of their thoughts ... that I was able
wholly, passionately, greatly, to give all my
mind, all my life to the white flame of intellectual
creation. But even this flame needed
its nourishment: was it logical to bring this
light to being and then let it die? The gross
man is nourished with gross food: the indifferent
man with any food at all. My high
work called for high fuel. Not for a drudge,
not for a harried woman, nor a pretty one,
nor for promiscuous pleasures. For Mildred!
the essential Mildred! Nothing less. And
the proof was that ere I had found the perfection
of her love, I had not been nourished at
all. Rather than blemish the fine growth of
my life, I had lived on myself, until I had
found my equal....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>Of all this, I said naught. I kissed my
mother’s accurately rouged cheek: I touched
my father’s hand, its soft complacence gave
me a savage turn. I went quickly to the
door.</p>

<p>My mother stopped me.</p>

<p>“John, I want you to come back. Are you
free Saturday? ... in the afternoon? I’ll
stay at home. Nothing has been decided. You
must not be hasty. I want to see——”</p>

<p>I saw them: so impervious and healthy.—From
their stubbornness, my will: from
their sheer animal strength, my mental power....
So flashed my thought, but not in irony:
a cool constatation.</p>

<p>I said:</p>

<p>“There is nothing for you to see. It doesn’t
matter. And everything has been decided.”</p>

<p>... I was in the street. And I had forgotten
my words, impetuous, boastful words
that seemed to mean nothing at all. For in
my consciousness there was the knowledge that
nothing had been decided: that my great need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
of winning Mildred and of having her right
was farther from fulfillment than it had ever
been.—Better go back, and not be proud: win
your mother, said my reason. I knew I would
not go back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span></p>

<h3><i>c</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;HAD left early, too early to rush precipitate
to Mildred. There was time to walk
to her, and in the blind congestion of my
thoughts the need of walking.</p>

<p>Spring was a haze within the quiet street.
The houses were high gray walls of emptiness.
Their windows told of no life. Life
was a fertile hush dreaming inchoate like a
stirless sea against these rocks of houses. I
walked as through some elemental birth, æons
anterior to men and cities; through sleepy and
vast densities scarce sparked with consciousness.
A monster too dull to be savage, too
close still to the protoplasmic slime, was this
Spring world sprawled upon the stone hills
of the city. And as I walked within its palpable
mood, my own thoughts clashed like
cymbals in a night: their strident clarities were
like a wound gashed in its somnolent flesh.</p>

<p>My thoughts stood apart from the city, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
from myself, and from each other. I knew
that I had come to a crisis in my years. I
needed Mildred and I needed my work. To
forego my impecunious glory upon the laboratory
battlefield meant death. To fail of Mildred
seemed to mean death, also. How could
I have them both? I had not even wooed her.
Her brilliant being stood beyond any touch
or any claim of mine. Had she been a woman
whom I could bind with sentimental promise
or engage with the zest of fighting with me
toward a dim future, she had not been Mildred.
She was alive, gloriously, luminously
alive. Like a flame she spent herself in the
day, and she might be gone to-morrow. Even
now, I could not tell but there was possibly
another’s love to fuel her. But even if she
could wait, could I? I knew at last the desperate
price of my abstaining years. There
was stored up in me a might of energy, continent,
compressed, and the fire touched it.
I was fire—a white totality of active hunger,
kindling, devouring in a moment the years’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
accumulated burden. I needed Mildred; and
needed her perfectly; and needed her at once.
I could not take her hidden, meanly, without
killing my great need ere its fulfillment. All
the ways of an inherited culture had this night
for me their reason. Beauty and amenity of
place, the lovely stuffs wealth has created for
its homes and bodies ... I saw them all as
acolytes of my essential worship. Mildred
stood helpless like a goddess: no man dared
take her without the fullest raiment and the
richest music, and a fair temple built to flesh
her spirit. Such were the exalted symbols
of my sense, but my thoughts were shrewd.
This perfect child was of the modern world.
To snatch her away would be to blemish her.
What the world could bring to make an harmonious
matrix for her life with me, in no way
changing her, was the instant need. Marriage
... a home. All else had been violence
rather than fruition: a gesture like that of a
crazed man who mars his love in the impotence
of desire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>But what hope was there? Why as I walked
through the high Spring-flushed night did I
not walk in despair? My mother was the implacable
foe of Mildred and in her hand was
a weapon she had already with sure instinct
wielded. And Mildred herself: what reason
had I to believe that she would love me, wed
me ... even if the way were clear? We were
friends. I had soon won from her the clear
note of her laughter. But her laughter surely
was no hidden grace that I alone could win.</p>

<p>She herself was the rare thing, and that all
life responded to her, that life’s common stuff
was by her alchemied into her gold. Since
she was perfect, why should she receive within
herself the transfigurement of love, the translation
of marriage? Mildred must have many
friends, many loves, for she was virginal not
by deprival but as a young birch is white.
She was intelligent; her mind had a luminous
response to every phase of the world that
touched her own. Her intelligence lived inseparate
within her senses, within her milk-pale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span> 
skin. But even so, could I imagine that
she would have responded to the mute beginnings
of my glory? What was I in her
eyes? A quiet man, young, fair-haired, with
deep gray eyes, not tall: evidently gifted, evidently
strong; a man who stood at the bottom
rung of a mysterious ladder that led to esoteric
formulæ about the stuffs and ways of human
brains. That much she might know. Could
she, for all her pure intelligence, know how
my science was to be a Dionysian dance: an
heroic poem in which I marshaled the harmonies
of nature, as once did Æschylus with his
Prometheus, or the old Jew with his Job?
Could she know that? and could I tell her
that? <i>Psychologist</i>: what a prosy lie the word
would give her! Oh, I had faith in myself
and faith in Mildred. But how could I hope
that she was ready to come to me knowing
me her equal, as I knew her my own?</p>

<p>—I should despair, I should despair!</p>

<p>And yet I did not. I walked with bright
thoughts through the soft fluxed night, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
the defeat with my parents, the uncertainty of
what lay beyond, did not make me despair.
Indeed my chances of battle did not hold my
thoughts. I walked in an exhilarant and scattered
mood as if the battle was already won,
and I could disband my army!</p>

<p>—Life is good. Why do I think this now?
Because of death. We are at war with death.
In the conflict, misery and hesitancy die. Joy
only lives. Life is good, not because life is
good but because we battle death. Blessed
is the foe, for he makes us blessed to ourselves.
This quiet street is quiet because just
beyond is the clatter of Broadway. Lights
there jerk in a shallow panic, therefore this
strip of sky between the houserows deepens
its gray blue. And the man who passes: he
is a soft and reticent word of flesh because
he is within stone lips of houses, because he
moves from clamor.... Mildred: what will
I say to her to-night? ... why have I thought
of death? I go to Mildred whom my life
loves; and I think of death, and I learn that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
it is the strangeness and the nearness of death
which makes life real!</p>

<p>I see a baby boy: he is in the street, he has
been struck and badly hurt by a stone. His
sister, scarcely larger than himself, leads him
across the gutter, screaming, homeward. Toddling
howling mite! His tears hold rage, fear,
protest, pain—no thought of death, no questioning
of life. No, he is wholly alive: life is
not good to him, nor does he love it: fatefully
and wholly he accepts it. For he thinks not
of death. Life may be anger and agony and
hunger, but it is everything.—Why then does
life seem marvelous to me, save that death must
be near? Mildred...? What if she is death
and wooing her, life wooes its end? and this
be the reason why in love life seems so marvelous
good? O Mildred, if this is death, let
death enfold me. If you are death, hurry me
to your flame-nothing beside which life—green
hills and creatures swarming in the sun—is a
gray sleep. You are not death, my love. You
are the golden trumpet calling me to life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>I see other things. Walking toward Mildred,
I see the city. Mildred colors the whole
strange story: that I am alive, that I am I,
now strange! And being strange, all is real,
all is inevitable. The real is mysteriously
new! Mildred in everything. She has unfolded
and become the world. Yet in this
ecstasy of clearness, I cannot even know if
she is life—or death!</p>

<p>But I do know how this city is a shell: how
life floods beyond it: a cracked shell, the city,
so that in little eddies life seeps in.</p>

<p>My vision seeps in, also. I am in a maze
of pictures. Mildred has released me from
herself to a bewildering freedom.</p>

<p>I can fly where I will, and enter where I
want. I see myriad women’s arms, suddenly
free and fragile like their hair. Women’s
arms wave, like hair, in a great wind. A wind
sweeps my maze of images: I see streaming
men and children and women. Each is
crouched close to another. They do not see
how they, are streaming, streaming. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
think of themselves as fixed, all else as moving.</p>

<p>But I am moving. Something in me is fixed,
and something in me is moving!...</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This is a pleasant room, and I am in it.</p>

<p>What room? Perhaps I am in my house
with Mildred, and I am to have a study generous
like this one. Am I in my own future,
then? Where am <i>I</i> if this is my own book-lined
study? Where is Mildred? Let me look
sharp and wait. Someone is there....</p>

<p>The room is high and long. Two windows
in one wall let in the budding tree-tops of a
square. The other walls rise in dark shelves,
open with books. Against the black of the
wood, the plaster wall is white.</p>

<p>A Tanagra spots it: a Chinese painting: a
little rustic jar that seems Etruscan or may be
from Peru. Someone is there. Not I. I am
not looking, in this torrent maze, on my own
future. For the man is not I. He is dark.
The lamp, blue Persian with a silk turret-shade
clouded like ivory, shadows half his face,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
a long and from the forehead tapering face,
and lights an eye that looks up now from his
book. The black hair curls on the forehead in
a rounded bang: like one of the saints on the
great Porch at Chartres. A noble face: the
nose is straight and the mouth warm-lipped
and large. Brow and curled hair give saintliness,
the nose is resolute and the mouth is
subtle. A variance of authority. He rises.
He is tall. His eyes become attentive and less
thoughtful. A regal man, now at his ease in
his home, in the negligee of a moire braided
jacket. There is someone else just come into
the room. The clear blue of the eyes is questioning.
Can this someone else be I? What
folly! Yet, if I can see this meditative man,
why should he not see me? What a vague mass
is the newcomer. I feel, rather than know it
for another man. If I look square for this
new presence, I shall lose the master of the
room.—<i>Watch the master close!</i> The sharp
question in his eyes hardens at this other in
the room, as at some ominous intruder. Immobile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
his face: he reaches out a hand. His
eyes do not lower to what is in his hand. I
feel his hand flex and relax and drop what
was in it. Only his eyes are clear, gazing at
this other in the room: and yet straight at me,
as if they gazed at me! The eyes fill with bitterness,
with horror that grows fixed and
leaves his eyes.... They die in resignation
... and their horror creeps now over my own
flesh. His hands fly above his head: so very
empty, so very white and tremulous his hands.
A knife in his breast. And all is gone....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>... Flowing rivers of faces, of lives
saying: “We are steadfast, we are solid,” as
they stream and faint. Now, the familiar
blank before my eyes. The normal street ...
I smile at my fancy. I laugh aloud, walking
now commonly. I call to my relief my easy
rational knowledge.</p>

<p>“No wonder if to-night you suffer from an
erratic gush of energy. Hyperæsthesia.
Here is Mildred’s house. This confidence ...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
call it euphoria, for that talk with your
parents was a blow, no doubt. Go ahead. A
mastering passion is right to admit no doubt.
Bad names can’t spoil the splendor of my
sureness. Go ahead. Win her. What lies
beyond this radiant mist? <i>Go on.</i>”</p>

<p>I rang the bell and gave my hat and coat
to the calming butler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span></p>

<h3><i>d</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT moment with the butler in the hall
was like a strip of arid land parting
two seas of my mind. As I went up the stairs,
all that had lived in me, walking through the
city, went ... went out, and I lived whole
in the imminent presence of Mildred. If I
had asked myself what I had thought, what
I had seen, out there, I could have answered
only: Mildred. But even to have asked the
question would have been impossible to me,
since every question and every answer now
was Mildred.</p>

<p>She opened, closed the door. Mildred is
in the room, with her hand still on the doorknob
and her eyes smiling upon me. Mildred
I know and following my eyes I find at last
myself, and still find only Mildred.</p>

<p>Let her stay there smiling, her slight
shoulders faintly straining back with her arms,
and the bare throat pulsant. Let her stay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
there holding me in her smile. For when she
moves, what will become of me? Her chin
is up: her face is inclined forward so that her
violet eyes lie under the half-shut lids and
peer at me. Her chin is a rounded, exquisite
apex, and the cheeks trace triangularly subtle
to the brow that is her chiefest glory. Mildred’s
hair is gold, and is banded high, freeing
all her forehead.</p>

<p>Let her stay there smiling, holding me in
her smile. With her arms’ strain as they clasp
the knob behind them, the shoulders are sheer
in the orange gauze of the gown: and the little
breasts are high and firm ... very high, and
strangely one with the throb of her throat!</p>

<p>Mildred comes forward and gives me both
her hands. Her arms are thin, they have
no molded beauty. They are like all her
body: no sculptured mass of flesh but a mysterious
stream of life swift-running, like white
fire ever within itself, yet fixed upon some pattern
immobile and essenced.</p>

<p>“Well,” comes her laughing voice. “You’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
early. And you’re out of breath. If you were
late that’d be more excusable. Sit down.”</p>

<p>I sit down, and I stand again.</p>

<p>“Mildred, I’m sorry I am out of breath.
But I have breath enough to say what must
come first of all this evening ... first of all,
all my life. Mildred, I love you.”</p>

<p>Her eyes deepen and grow soft. Her delicate
face is a hard fragility about the brooding
thought of her eyes. She sits down.</p>

<p>“Come,” she says in a voice that is like her
eyes even as before it had been like her face.
“Sit down beside me, John. Here.”</p>

<p>She leads me, holding my hand. When I
am beside her on the couch her hand lifts from
mine as if it had been kissed.</p>

<p>“You mean,” she said, “that you love me
really, John? that you want me to live with
you, John?”</p>

<p>“I want you to be my wife.”</p>

<p>“Does that mean, you are sure you love only
me? That you will never want to live with
another woman?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>My eyes gave her my answer: she saw in
them, also, my surprise at her questions. She
went blithely on.</p>

<p>“Could you love me, John, and also sometimes
still love someone else?”</p>

<p>“It might be, Mildred. But in that case
I would not now pray as I do, that you may
become my wife.”</p>

<p>She looked down at my hand and her little
fist beat on it softly.</p>

<p>“How am I to know?”</p>

<p>“Mildred, know what...?”</p>

<p>“If you said to me: ‘Give me a kiss,’ I would
kiss you for I feel like that. If you said to
me: ‘Come with me for a week,’ I would say
yes, for I think that for a week I could be
sure that I would feel that way ... and if
I did not, why a week comes to a close. But
no man asks me that! No man tries to kiss
me. They all say: ‘Mildred, I love you. I
shall always love you. I want you for my
wife.’ That means forever and ever. You
are all so sure. How can I be sure?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“Will you give me a kiss, Mildred?”</p>

<p>She leaned forward and her lips were
faintly parted. My mouth touched hers, and
my eyes saw within her gown her perfect
breasts like porcelain cups, red-tipped....
She was straight again and smiling. I hid
my face in my arms, fighting to master the
storm that her cold lips had loosed.</p>

<p>“John ... did my kiss hurt you, then?”</p>

<p>“No, Mildred. But I suffer. You are so
perfect and so brave: and you feel nothing.”</p>

<p>“That is not so! I liked your kiss.”</p>

<p>“Mildred, beside the anguish and the joy
that I feel, you feel nothing.”</p>

<p>She held my hand in her two palms.</p>

<p>“Tell me what to do.”</p>

<p>“Believe in me, Mildred.”</p>

<p>“Why, I do believe in you!”</p>

<p>“Above all else ... above all others.”</p>

<p>“Why? Why must it be only you?”</p>

<p>“Because that is love, Mildred. Because I
could not bear it any other way. Because the
death of not having you would be as nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
beside the death of sharing you even with another’s
thought. Because only in the unity, in
the solitary oneness of two souls can love live.”</p>

<p>Mildred shook her head, and her gold curls
rang about her ears.</p>

<p>“You talk like someone else. Yes,” she
faced me, “someone who loves me, too, and
wants me whole and for always and can’t bear
any other eyes but his own looking upon me.
Someone else whose wishes I’d obey reasonably,
John, as I obeyed yours, when you said:
‘Give me a kiss.’” Her eyes were cool and
happy despite their problem. “But he doesn’t
ask reasonable things. He wants me forever
and ever. How can I promise him that? And
how can I promise him what I can’t give him
at once?”</p>

<p>“Who is he, Mildred?” I forced the words
and they came like gray ghosts out of my
mouth.</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t know him. I’ve known him
long. And he’s wonderful, too. Like you
are. But different. In every way, different.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
You don’t,” she smiled, “encroach on each
other at all. He’s big and dark, and rather
slow. And you are wonderfully quick. He
is a poet and smells always of pipe tobacco.
His hands are gnarled....”</p>

<p>“He loves you.”</p>

<p>“I think as much as you do, John. His
words are strangely like yours, even though
he himself is so different. That is important,
is it not? He asked me one reasonable thing
... one thing I could do.”</p>

<p>“What was that, Mildred?”</p>

<p>“To come to his rooms.”</p>

<p>“Mildred!”</p>

<p>“He has a lovely place down on Washington
Square. I supposed, when he had me
there, he’d want to kiss me. But no ... he’s
unreasonable, just like you. He frightened
me. He left me so alone. I was almost chilly,
I assure you. With his pacing up and down:
saying ‘I love you. I want you. I love you,’
and not even taking my hand.” She reached
for mine. “You see,” she smiled, “he is even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
less reasonable than you. You at least
kissed me.”</p>

<p>I was up from the couch. She had held
my hand. I snatched it from her. I began
to pace, till the thought came that <i>he</i> had done
this. I stopped and faced her. I pulled her
up and held her in my arms. I covered her
face with kisses. I found her throat in my
dazed ecstasy; I pressed my mouth within the
gauze of her gown. Her cool hand stopped
me, and she held me off.</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “No, I cannot.”</p>

<p>“Why? If you mean what you said.
Why?”</p>

<p>Her eyes took on a serious dark question:
and I knew how right I was to love her for
the splendor of her chastity. For ere she
answered me, she was seeking deep within her
soul the reason, the quiet reason.</p>

<p>In that true moment when with head
bowed she went within herself to give me answer
why she had denied me, I knew the greatness
of my love, and how she was greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
than I, and how my sultry passion had been
an ugly shred tangenting from my love.</p>

<p>“Mildred,” I said in her silence, “you will
give your answer. But in your search
I can tell you already that you were right;
even for my sake, in the light of my own love,
you were right to hold me off. You cannot be
taken that way. You cannot be stormed.
Mating with you must be the peaceful meeting
of two equal wills. And it must come to
be within a quiet deep and great like itself.
There is a passionate stillness more powerful
than any tempest. I shall not kiss you again,
my love, until you know that kiss for the
threshold to our life.”</p>

<p>Her eyes were heavy with thinking. They
grew bright.</p>

<p>“Then you agree, even in that, with Philip!”</p>

<p>I nodded. I could not hate him when his
name, whoever he was, lived on her lips.</p>

<p>“And now I can tell you why I pushed
you off.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mildred?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>She moved her head slowly from side to
side; she sat down; she smoothed her gown
downward from her neck.</p>

<p>“I have learned something ... here.”
Her hands with a sharp candor, while her eyes
met mine, followed the gauze I had ruffled,
and cupped her breasts. “I care for you, and
I care for Philip. I thought that was enough:
that I could blindly let time order ... time
and mood ... what each of you wanted of
me, and what I wanted to give. It is not so.
Time counts terribly! Before I can give myself
to either of you, I must know which of
you I want to take me first. And then I feel
... I feel, when I have learned who is first,
there may be no second!”</p>

<p>“Mildred, you see that I was right? You
have learned what I knew when I first saw
you. Before I saw you I held myself for you.
I denied myself. Not only did I know there
could be no one beyond you ... none even
before you!”</p>

<p>She was murmuring almost to herself: “It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
was your mouth on my breast. Your hot
mouth marking my flesh, that made me
know....”</p>

<p>“You would have hated me, were it not
I....”</p>

<p>She shook her head: “Philip might have
kissed me. How should I know?”</p>

<p>I smiled. “There is no hurry, dear. Wait.
I shall be patient. Wait.”</p>

<p>She hid her face a moment in her hands.
And lifting them again, her eyes laughed hard
and strong in her fragile face.</p>

<p>“Oh, patience! Bother patience! Why
should we wait? Why can’t we know now?
I want to know. If Philip were only here,
I’d know soon enough. The others don’t
count. Really ... how wonderfully simple
when there are only two. And you call for
patience. Timid! I’ll phone for Philip. Yes,
I will. If he’s home, I’ll phone and I’ll go
over there: or have him come here quick....
You really should meet him.” Her smile was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
above malice. “And I’ll know perhaps, just
if I look at him.”</p>

<p>She danced toward the door. There was
a knock that stopped her. She moved slowly,
suddenly transfigured, and turned the knob.
A maid stood hesitant.</p>

<p>“Miss Fayn, it’s something urgent, Miss.
Your father would like to speak to you just
a minute.”</p>

<p>Mildred looked at me. There was a pallor
over the bloom of her cheeks. Her eyes still
danced, unknowing, within an invading pallor.
I was alone.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A stillness lay within the room that had
rung and sung with the dancing laughter of
Mildred. Mildred was gone: and someone
else is here! Who is here, blighting this room?
I stand and feel a horror rise from my loins
like a gray cloud ... up, up my sides it
crawls: lifting my hair it passes. I forced
myself to look over each shoulder: nothing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
It is gone. What is it that was here and that
I have not seen and that I felt I knew? A
foul dark mass in the shrine of Mildred’s room.
But the horror that scudded through me is
away. Thoughts come. Good thoughts.
Chasing all others.—Mildred is mine, is mine!
And she is wonderful beyond my wonder.</p>

<p>... She opened the door and I shuddered
for on her face was the darkness that had been
alone with me.</p>

<p>“Oh,” came her voice, reed-like and
stripped. “Oh, he is dead.”</p>

<p>I looked my amazed question: knew I was
looking it.</p>

<p>—Your father? Not your father?</p>

<p>“You never saw Philip LaMotte.”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“You will never see him. Nor I, again.”</p>

<p>From within her eyes the shadow came to
me and awoke my skin once more to the
familiar horror.</p>

<p>“He is dead.”</p>

<p>I was silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“They telephoned my father. Papa and he
were friends. Philip has been murdered!”</p>

<p>I saw her, saw above all my transcendant
need of her like a new radiance within her
body. The bewildered cloud upon her face
of sorrow was an intruder, a foe.</p>

<p>—You are mine. All else is trampled out
in the march of my love.... She would not
have it so. She stood there sorrowing. I took
her hand, and her touch said: “He is murdered.”
It was a film, viscous between us.</p>

<p>But still I could say nothing. I held her
hand: I dared not loose it just because it
said: “He is murdered.” Why should I be
downed by that? Whether it helped or no
what did it avail against my mastering need?
But the touch of her limp hand spoke, spoke
again. My clasp fought vainly, drawing in
the foe, in the attempt to shut him out. Mildred
withdrew her hand, and left in mine the
word of her own:</p>

<p>“Philip is murdered.”</p>

<p>I forced myself to say: “I will leave you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
love. I cannot help you now. You will want
to be alone.”</p>

<p>She nodded and her eyes avoided mine.</p>

<p>“It is terrible,” she spoke in a voice
strangely casual and high. “Who could have
murdered Philip? Sweet, gentle Philip.
Great Philip. I am all dazed. We spoke of
murder in his room, that day.”</p>

<p>“You spoke of murder?”</p>

<p>“Philip said to me: ‘You are the woman for
whom man kills. I could kill for you, Mildred.’”</p>

<p>“Dear, even the past is drawn into the dark
design of an event that sweeps us. Philip
was rich——?”</p>

<p>“I know.” She did not like my reasoning.
“I am dazed. I want to go to bed ... and
to sleep. Leave me, John.”</p>

<p>Still her eyes kept from my own. She had
been glorious in my need of her. Now shattered
and distraught with the shadow on her
fragrance, she was almost ugly. Her arms
were thin as she twisted her hands together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
and her neck was long: and her eyes drooped
heavy down.</p>

<p>—Why is she ugly? I did not love her less.
The ugliness I felt was a pain added to the joy
of loving her. And then, a dim sense came.
It was to grow ever less dim.—She is befouled
with a thought! And that thought is
my own. She has been fair like a dawn with
the dawn of my love and now my thought
clouds her.</p>

<p>—Why is she dark? Because this murder
will concern me!... So much I knew an
instant, and forgot. I left her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span></p>

<h3><i>e</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;AM home. The lamp reveals my study,
sharp: a changeling! White curtains in
the deep-set latticed windows, shelves of books,
the couch right angle to the open hearth, the
low gray ceiling ... nothing is moved yet
everything is changed. A glow like fever
hushes in the shadow, the dull familiar things
swell with vibrance into a dimension new like
an omen.</p>

<p>I sit down, carefully folding my coat.—No
wonder. What a shock! What a night. I
huddle in my dressing gown and greet the
smoke of my pipe.—No wonder. I take my
book.</p>

<p>—Better read.</p>

<p>Above my shoulder, as I sit with the lamp
close on the plain pine table is a separate shelf:
books on astrology. The book I hold is bound
in ivory parchment, cracked: the Gothic type
stands bold on the soft paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>I begin to read where only yesterday I
placed my mark. Yesterday and this page:
to-day and this page again. How can such difference
meet upon a page? But why so whole
a difference? What has happened? Your
parents—nothing definitive there. Nothing is
lost there, surely. What you anticipated was:
what is anticipated, is. Make them understand.
There is a way, if not to make them
understand, at least to <i>make</i> them.... This
sense of an abysmal separateness in your eye
trying to link the words upon the page with
words an eye of yours saw yesterday, could
not be born of what happened with your parents.
Philip—what of that? When he was
a danger, you did not know of him: now that
you know of him, he is dead. The danger is
dead. She did not yet love him. He made
claim upon her, my one rival claim: and life
has withdrawn it for me. A shock—she will
need time—but she will recover! Did this
murder shake her whom he loved as much as
me who never saw him? Why not be glad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
then, if she be not too shaken? Do you want
her prostrate? What folly is this in your will?
Are the gifts of event less welcome than the
gifts of nature? Aren’t you glad you have
a body and a mind welcome to Mildred?
Don’t you accept whatever vantage they give
you? Why not accept the vantage of events?
How can you help accept? John Mark, will
you be morbid, like other men, when the sun
and moon of life shine full on you?...
Better read.</p>

<p>—If there is something in all this, this
strangeness in you: something beside the tumult
of your love, and the shock of learning
how close to your desire was another hand, hot
and touching your own as you reached—if
there is something else, you’ll see it clearer in
the morning. Don’t push your clarity. Let
it ripen. Dangerously close his hand to your
own? It is gone.... He may not be dead?
... a wound? No, he is murdered. And
that is forever.</p>

<p>—Mildred is strangely dim. My memory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
and the note of my taut nerves tell me best
at this moment how I love her. I want to
see her. I want to have her vividly here. To
corroborate what? I want to see again that
first time when I saw her....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Evening, a dance. The electric lamps drive
a stiff flood of light through the gold-paneled
room. No air—this atmosphere is a harsh
painted substance. Men and women are
brittle or are cloying: their spirit is dark as if
no air had ever entered them. The music is
a weave of stuffs contorted, writhed, a hypocritical
plea for gayety: its sinuous lies move
through the hall and through the bodies of the
dancers with a false laughter, with a macabre
rhythm. Cynic music, substitute in this world
for breath; as are the lamps for light....
And the coupled forms jerking slow in its
rugose waves.</p>

<p>Then, I see Mildred! I have met her before:
casually, more than once. Now, for the
first time, there is the grace in me to see her!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>She is air, open and coursing: she is sunlight.
Her solidity is resilient. She has a
body which is a luminous smile, impervious
and ruthless.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” I ask her.
For her antithesis is so exact ... the velvety
music, the slow whining bodies ... that she
is clear like a poem in a world of inarticulations.</p>

<p>“Let’s talk,” she says. “It will be good for
you to talk. Your mood is so heavy.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“Where else did you expect to find me?”</p>

<p>“I expected to find you nowhere.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t know who I am.”</p>

<p>“You are Mildred Fayn. I have seen you:
and I have heard of you.”</p>

<p>“Well, then? Did you not hear that I
dance, that I motor, that I ride? Did you
not hear that I flirt?”</p>

<p>“Whatever I heard and saw has naught to
do with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“You look, Doctor Mark, as if you had
made a discovery. And you look solemn.”</p>

<p>“I am pleased.”</p>

<p>“You are like a child, perhaps? Most solemn
when most pleased?”</p>

<p>“Children have the gift of discovery—and
of wonder.”</p>

<p>Suddenly she was serious. She had glanced
dazzlingly around me. Now it was as if she
came straight forward.</p>

<p>“I’ll dare be ‘serious’ with you,” she murmured.</p>

<p>She looked full at me: her eyes had a crisp
tenderness, like some immortal fruit ever upon
the Springlike verge of ripeness. I knew that
she understood, although the words perhaps
were not within her mind, how laughter is
oblique: how seriousness is the full face of joy.</p>

<p>We sat in a little bower cut off from the
hall by palms. It became a cool and fluid
haven from the hall—from the hall’s synthetic
sun. She was quiet. She folded her
frail hands in her lap and raised her head.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
A smile flickered at her mouth like a butterfly
at a fruit. She dispelled it.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to sit serious,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“It is so revealing.”</p>

<p>Again, instantly, she understood.</p>

<p>“Yes: we don’t mind being naked when we
are in motion. It must be that motion covers
us? The dance, the swim. But being still,
and being seen....”</p>

<p>“Laughter,” I said, “is a shift we wear like
motion.”</p>

<p>There was a pause. I illogically broke it:
“You are uncovered, yet you are at ease.”</p>

<p>She laughed: “No! You are wrapping
me up in your observations about me.”</p>

<p>“Why do they cover, rather than reveal
you?”</p>

<p>“Why? Because they are illusions.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Aren’t they romantic and inaccurate?
You see, I <i>am</i> a girl who dances and motors
and flirts.” Her smile was indulgent: as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
she invited me, knowing how hard it was, to
candor.</p>

<p>“How can you expect me to know you so
swiftly?”</p>

<p>“Why not—swiftly?” she said.</p>

<p>I was aware of her as if she had been naked.
I leaned forward in my chair: she lay back
in hers, with an ankle poised upon the other.
She knew my awareness, and was unashamed.
There was naught sensual in my knowing her.
She did not challenge my sense: she challenged
my understanding. Her emerald dress
gleamed in fluid angles over her hips, around
her waist and breast. She was not naked,
after all: she was clad in a cool flame aura of
which her eyes were the measureless sources.</p>

<p>“I am going to leave you here,” I said at
last. “I want to see you again. You will
let me see you again?”—Again, again! oh,
forever, shouted my heart. “But not again
in that lewd place, with its plush music and
its sticky light.”</p>

<p>“Where?” she asked. My violence was beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
her. She did not think of the dance as
anything but pleasant. And the music was
to her the usual dance music.</p>

<p>“In your home.”</p>

<p>“Come, surely,” she agreed. She gave me
her hand.</p>

<p>I had many words, and she had none. My
words were my ignorance: her wisdom was
itself, needing no concepts. In that moment,
I learned that also words—like motions—were
shifts of incompleteness. I grew ambitious
as I had never been before. Long I had willed
to be great as men are great. And since I had
first seen her on this night I had dared to want
her, as man possesses woman. Now I longed
more vertiginously far: I longed to be able
to achieve the domain beyond words, beyond
conscious acts—to exert the wisdom of power,
somehow, beyond the articulation of my mind;
even as she was wise in the absolute miracle
of her thoughtless body. So fragile, so profoundly
luminous she was! her eyes, her face,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
her form the entexture of a petal in which all
immensity lay glowing.</p>

<p>—To be a man is misery! Yet to hold her,
I must be a man. I understood the wisdom of
beauty, its undimensioned power: and how
intellect and words are its groveling slaves. I
envied this girl, I with my man’s mind. I resolved
to equal her in her own high domain....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But now I cannot even see her! Though I
recount this scene, it sleeps pale in my mind.
And if she come at all, it is otherwise than in
her relevation of the world beyond our conscious
words—it is as I saw her last, diminished
and blemished by a thought of my own!</p>

<p>—Is this why my love of her dims? Tides
... the energy that swells my love (do not
torment yourself) has ebbed into other harbors,
for an hour. Were this not so, life would
grow stagnant in my love, and my love grow
foul like a hooded and shut pool. You must
understand this, always, Mildred (what do
you not understand?): how the waters of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
life move out from you, and then move in on
you replenished with the verdance of their
wanderings....—Better not think of her
now, nor of the man murdered, nor of the hard
enameled cheek of mother.—Better read....</p>

<p>Like all else in my life, the study in the
pseudo-science of astrology is at once joy in
my life and design in my work. I strive, as
man has always striven, to drown this anguish
of being born a man, within the stars. I cannot.
For the stars are not greater, truer than
my passions; their convolutions do not make
my thoughts petty and unrelated; nor are
they closer to God than my own searching will.
The solace of lies is denied me. All my life
has battled against the ease of falsity and sentiment.
The solace of the Truth——?</p>

<p>Oh, I am small indeed, small and imperfect:
no stronger and no greater than those whirling
stars. But if they swing sure (an instant) in
balance of the truth, cannot I? Gravitation—it
is a phase of will, a phase of fragmentary
conscience, making these stars swing true,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
<i>one with the other</i>. Let my thoughts do likewise!</p>

<p>I plunge once more into the symphony of
search. We must move (it is the fate of
imperfection: that we must seem to move):
our hope is to move in unison with all
the other parts of God. For the harmonious
sum of movements is immobile—is Truth’s still
image. Work that seeks not respite, that
seeks knowledge, is indeed holy: for it binds
pitiful man into this symphony.</p>

<p>I think of the design on a man’s palm. Is
the design of the stars a similar chart recording
the destiny of man’s brain? Of course, there
is rapport here—but of what nature? Man’s
destiny, the graph of molecule, cell, electron in
man’s brain, and the congeried stars—are they
related as will, voice, phonographic record
(where then is the Will?), or as simultaneous
projections of some body that includes us all?
This search is my work. I feel with exquisite
anguish how the heavens will help me. The
vulgar idea of the phonographic record is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
unreal. The stamp of voice and the record in
the wax are not cause and effect: or rather,
cause and effect are but relative revelations to
our minds of two facts as simultaneous and organic
as the two faces of a coin. Even so the
correspondence between braincell and star is
organic, integral and formal. Braincell and
star are related like the chemic stresses of a
body. But our point of reference is the mind,
and the mind still thinks alas! in scaffold terms
of space, of cause and effect, of time. Hence,
the sideral design appears <i>beyond</i> us, and appears
always changing. Our limitation paints
the human drama. Two infants dropped
from one womb meet star-wordings abysmally
separate. All—from the plane of the womb
to the farthest sideral sweep—has changed to
human consciousness and will, in the instant
between the births. The brains of the infants
are two: the foci of their minds make of the
stars two sentences—and of their lives two
solitudes forever....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>I stand before these clumsy artefacts of the
child-seers ... the astrologers ... and behold
the stuff of a great thought! Am I not
young, exhilarant, equipped? There is the
event, threefold expressed for our three-dimensioned
mind: the stars speak the event,
human life enacts it, histology and biologic
chemistry release it. What a <i>Rosetta Stone</i>
for the unsealing, not of the written word of
dead Egyptians, but of the living word of
God! Thought and its chemic symbols in
brain and body, act in human history and its
wording in the sideral cosmos—they are my
materials, and they are docile in my hand! I
shall create an Axiom in the science of man:
his conscious part in God....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But this is not for to-night. The black type
of my book is gray. Other signs fill my room....
Mildred and love, fear and hate and horror.
Why not read <i>them</i>, since they are clamorous
near? Are they perhaps as true as the
stars? What is <i>their</i> symbol yonder?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>Molecules of brain, and flaming suns aflicker
like ghosts through emptiness. Are they
will-o’-the-wisps misleading me from emptiness
which is perhaps the truth?</p>

<p>I am unhappy. My life which I have given
to proud search, it seems to-night that I have
cast it away on nothing. Emptiness fills my
room. <i>Between and beyond the stars, is there
not Emptiness?</i> I have not Mildred. Shall
I win her? What else is there to win?</p>

<p>Cosmos is a black cavern zero-cold, and the
star-worlds flashing their feeble fires are lost.
If they and we embody God, is God not also
lost? Infinite cold, infinite blind blackness:
vagrant mites spitting their star fire into tiny
corners. How do I know these flame-specks
are my fate? Why not the vaster spaces in
between? the spaces empty, the spaces zero-cold?
Perhaps the fate of Philip is a sun,
burnt out. And my own, the black void that
will never burn.... I lay aside my book.
Its arrogant hopes seem childish. Are no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
men born to utter upon earth the Black that
gapes between the closest stars?</p>

<p>Yet why think so? That Black is an illusion.
Space does not exist: emptiness is but
your ignorance. The void between and beyond
the stars is the void within your fragmentary
knowledge. And through this fact, the void
cannot concern you, since only knowledge
longs and only knowledge hurts. But were
it even so, why fear the void? What is there
to fear in emptiness? Fear is not emptiness.
Your fear denies your fear.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>—O my beloved: this grandiose lack is only
lack of you!</p>

<p>How came I to love you? When my young
mind moved toward the mysteries of flesh, it
was not your flesh made the search sweet.
When my young spirit went upon its journey,
knowing there was no end, it was not your
spirit made the journey sweet. You have come
late upon me: yet all my seeking is dead without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
you, and all my seeking has come full upon
you! When I first saw you, my thought was
not to kiss your mouth, but to achieve a knowledge
and a power, like your own beauty’s
wisdom beyond words. What mystery is this?—And
what mystery is my despair to-night?
Am I not close to Mildred? Could not a fool
see in her luminous candor the dawn of love?
There was a danger, and that danger is dead!
While it lived....</p>

<p>I pace my room: back and forth from the
recessed windows to the wall where stands a
little table with a vase holding a white lily.
And I try to think.</p>

<p>—You must see. You must understand.</p>

<p>Yes, yes. I have gone too far to fall back
easefully on ignorance.</p>

<p>—You must probe. You must understand.</p>

<p>Yes, yes. I look at my books.</p>

<p>—Not that.</p>

<p>I think of Mildred.</p>

<p>—Not Mildred....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>I stand still: a shudder swarms my skin,
draws my throat taut, uprises in my hair....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>... the white room larded with books: the
face noble and reticent, and the swift births
of amaze, of pity, of horror ... indecorous
death. Pale hands fluttering up like rebellious
dreams—and fallen.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>My own hands bar my eyes.... How do I
know this is not morbid nonsense?</p>

<p>—What then is sense?</p>

<p>I am not so used to murder that this news,
passionately close to my love’s life, should
not move me.</p>

<p>—I do not blame you, that you are moved.</p>

<p>“<i>What can I do?</i>”</p>

<p>I speak these words aloud, and the despair
that dwells in them takes shape. Shape of
an impulsion. I know already what I am
going to do. But I contrive even now to
laugh at myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>—Fine man of science, driven by despair.
Illogical, driven man!</p>

<p>I take off my clothes, and though the night
is warm, I shiver in my bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span></p>

<h3><i>f</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;AM asleep and dawn is all about me:
dawn within me: I am up from bed and
I am putting on my clothes. My face in the
mirror wakes me. I am half dressed already,
and my mind says: “You must not forget to
shave.” I see my face. The mirror is by the
window, it stands on a highboy in my bedroom.
Dawn is a mingling of stirs: whistle of boat in
the river fog, rattle of wagon in the gray cool
mists turning and twisting, footbeat solitary
on the damp hard pavement—this is dawn
coming by the window into my room, to my
face. I look at my face, and then my face
awakes me.</p>

<p>I put a fresh blade in my razor and shave
swiftly. I take off the underwear of yesterday
that my hands, while I slept, put on: I
bathe cold: I dress fast.</p>

<p>The street is not different from the dawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
that drenched my room. Stone is solitary,
damp: houses are stifled by the night that they
hold, that is passing. I buy a <i>Times</i> and a
<i>World</i> at the corner stand where the dark
hunched man with thick glasses and a bristling
beard gazes at me with exaggerated eyes. I
do not look at the paper, waiting for the car.
As I sit in the car, I read quietly what I expected
to find. Here is the substance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is a simple case. Mr. LaMotte’s serving
man, Frank Nelson, is implicated and
is already in the Tombs. His master gave
him the evening off, and clearly the crime
could not have been committed without
knowledge of this and of the fact that Mr.
LaMotte was alone. At about 8.30, a
man came to the apartments where Mr.
LaMotte has his chambers and told the
colored doorboy, Elijah Case, that he had
an important note to be delivered in person.
Elijah phoned up and Mr. LaMotte
responded. Elijah carried the man to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
third floor, pointed out the door, heard
the messenger knock, saw him enter ...
and went down. Little time passed before
the elevator signal rang again.
Elijah went up, opened the elevator door
and the messenger stepped in.... Elijah
recalls him clearly. “How do you
happen to be so certain?” the police asked
him. “I dunno. But I is.” He says the
man was dressed entirely in black, and
that his head was white. “Do you mean
white like a <i>white man</i>?” “Nossah ... I
means white lak ... lak chalk.”
“Even his hair?” “I don’ remember no
hair. A white head. Da’s all.” “Even
his eyes?” Elijah shuddered. “Yessah.
Dey was white, too.”... The police
infer that the colored boy, who is simple-minded
and imaginative, made up his
monster after he had learned the event.
In any case, Elijah went back to his little
hall office: and shortly after a call came
in, by phone, for Mr. LaMotte. No: Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
LaMotte had no private phone. Instructions
were, not to say in any instance
whether Mr. LaMotte was at home, to
get the name and announce it first. It
was Mrs. LaMotte, the deceased’s mother.
She often called, and although frequently
Mr. LaMotte would tell the boy: “Say
I am not at home” ... that doubtless
was why he used the house phone ...
never in the three years Elijah had
worked at the apartment had Mr. LaMotte
failed to answer his signal, and
never had he refused to speak to his
mother. Elijah phoned up, now, and received
no answer. This satisfied the
mother who rang off. But it began to
trouble Elijah. Mr. LaMotte never
walked down, and also he never left without
giving word to the boy. During all
that time, Elijah had not been required
to leave his little office in full view of the
hall. Finally, Elijah was scared. He
phoned again. No answer. He went up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
and rang, and pounded on the door. He
went down into the Square and found an
officer. They broke open the door, for
the pass-key was with the janitor who
was away.... The murdered man was
lying on his back in the library, with a
wound in his heart. There was little
blood, no weapon, no sign of a struggle.
But the weapon must have been a long
and slender knife aimed with rare accuracy.
Nothing seemed to be missing.
The small safe in a recess of a bookcase
was shut, no fingerprints were found.
If the object was theft, the valuable
stolen is unknown and hence its loss is still
a mystery. Or else the thief was frightened
off ... that happens. A simple
case, which leaves the police in confidence
of a quick solution....</p>
</div>

<p>I noted the address and left my papers on
the foul straw seat of the car. A man with
a skull-like head, skin yellow and tough and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
eyes that bulged with a lost tenderness,
reached out for them. Leaving, I was aware
of the two mournful rows of humans facing
each other like lugubrious birds on swinging
perches.... I found the number and flashed
my police card at a brown boy who took me
up: the wonder in his eyes was mingled with
proprietory pride at his connection with a
headline murder. At the door stood a policeman.
I heard myself say, coolly:</p>

<p>“I am Doctor Mark of the Institute.” I did
not show my card.</p>

<p>He understood nothing, and was impressed
by me. I was beginning to be impressed by
myself.</p>

<p>Alone in the hall, I hesitated.—I need still
not go in. Someone was in the room, and he
would come, and I could talk with him explaining
my personal interest in a friend.
Why not go in? What was I doing here? I
had come like an automaton sprung by the
despair of the distant night. Moving, I lost
my agony. Even this single stationary moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
in the hall brought to my nerves a starting
pain as if to stand still were some unnatural
act forced by my will on my body.—Let
me go on. The door opened, and a
blunt big man scrutinized me with the vacuous
stare that doubtless he took for subtlety. I
watched myself dispose:</p>

<p>“I am Doctor Mark of the Institute.” I
showed him my card, “... and a friend: a
family friend.” I did not hesitate. I wore a
light top coat, and I took it off.</p>

<p>The man softened and nodded.</p>

<p>“I am Lieutenant Gavegan.” We shook
hands. “He’s in there, sir.” He pointed with
his thumb in a miracle of reticent grace.
There was a pause in which my will must have
spoken. For he said, as if in answer:</p>

<p>“I suppose I can leave you alone in there,
sir, a few moments. Don’t touch nothing.”</p>

<p>I saw the image of a cigar in his flat mind
as he moved toward his friend, the officer at
the entrance. I shut the door behind me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span></p>

<h3><i>g</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;KNEW this room. The regimented
books marched high toward the high ceiling:
the subtle notes upon the shelves of color
and of plastic twisted like flageolets in a
bright cadenza down against the stout march
of the books. The square room veered
roundly, the ceiling vaulted: all was a concave
shut and yet wide about this man who lay
upon the floor.</p>

<p>I knew the room, and I was not amazed.
Casual thoughts....—Mildred was here:
you are the woman for whom men kill, a white-faced
man killing with shiny boots ...
went through my mind as I leaned down: I
was unamazed and cool, lifting the sheet that
lay upon the body.</p>

<p>The face did not stop me. I opened the
white shirt with its solid bubbles of blood, and
my sure hands went to the wound. The blade
had been struck from a point higher than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
breast, so that its angle from above was acute.
It had passed through the pectoralis major and
minor muscles, through the fourth intercostal
space, and into the right auricle of the heart.
The ascending portion of the aorta had been
severed. Death was immediate and clean. No
surgeon with a body prostrate under his hand
could have cut better. This body now was
prostrate before me. Swiftly, my eyes
measured it: it was six feet, possibly six feet
two.... I folded back the shirt, and now,
as if I had been satisfied, I looked at the face
of Philip LaMotte.</p>

<p>I studied the face which, not twelve hours
since, had come to me in the apocalyptic street.
A white pallor overlaid the rich dark pigmentation.
The beard stubble had grown: it emphasized
the accurate delicacy of the chin and
the tender strength of the lips. The nose
arched high. The brow was serenely broad:
the black curled hair, like a filet, came low
and round. The shut eyes made the vision
startling: a Saint of the Chartres Porche.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>I saw myself crouched over this slain saint
whom death had sculpted into marble. My
mind remarked with an aloof surprise, how
little my observations and my will at work surprised
me. Was I discovering, indeed? or was
I appraising? Was I probing a crime that for
good cause haunted me, or was I reviewing
... reviewing——?</p>

<p>I was on my knees crouched over the body
of Philip LaMotte. I heard the door. I
looked up at the figure of Detective Gavegan.
With careful grace, I arose.</p>

<p>“Does the boy Case have a good memory of
the man’s size, who brought the message?”</p>

<p>“He says: about medium size.”</p>

<p>“How tall is Case?”</p>

<p>“You saw him. He’s a short darkey.”</p>

<p>“If the man’d been Mr. LaMotte’s size,
Case would have known it?”</p>

<p>“Six foot, one and a half? Well, I guess.”
Gavegan flattened his eyes once more upon
me in a simagre of study.</p>

<p>“I know what you’re thinkin’,” he snickered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
“They all likes to play detective. How could
so short a man have finished him so fine? Size
ain’t strength, Doctor Mark: no more than
a big man need lack for wits.” Gavegan’s
huge form swelled.</p>

<p>I watched him. The hopelessness of making
him respond to my discoveries, still so
dark to myself, fought against a pleasant call
in me that it would be wrong to hide anything
from the law.</p>

<p>“Has that message ... has any letter been
found?”</p>

<p>He shook his head wisely. “No: nor there
won’t be. The final examination is this morning.
That’s why the body ain’t yet been removed.
But there won’t be. That letter was
mere pretext.”</p>

<p>“This looks a simple case to you?”</p>

<p>“Plain motive. Theft. How do you know
what Mr. LaMotte was carryin’ in his pocket
just last night? The butler knew. Mebbe
a jewel for a girl. Or a bundle of securities.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
Surely a wad of bills, and he preparin’ for a
journey.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he was preparing for a journey?”</p>

<p>Gavegan gave me a gentle look of pity.</p>

<p>“Come over here,” he beckoned with his
head. On a small teak-wood desk between
the windows, lay a diary pad bound in black
levant. It was open to this day. There was
one note, scrawled small in pencil:</p>

<p>“<i>Gr Ct M 10.30</i>”</p>

<p>I fingered the pad. There were almost no
other entries.</p>

<p>“What do you think that means?”</p>

<p>Gavegan loomed. “Grand Central Station.
Train at 10.30. And meetin’ there with
... M.”</p>

<p>“Plausible,” I said, and was unsure if I
agreed or if I mocked. “I suppose you know
already who is ‘M’?”</p>

<p>He eyed me with omniscience. “That we
don’t give out, sir. Even to a distinguished
friend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“But the wound, Gavegan! Have you
looked at the wound?”</p>

<p>He was stupid. I prepared to tell my
thoughts. Was it because or despite that he
was too stupid to receive them?</p>

<p>“The wound might puzzle you, I think, if
you had studied more anatomy. The man
who dealt it did so from above, for it struck
the right auricle of the heart at an angle of
less than forty-five degrees! How could a
short man do that to a man six feet one and a
half? And how could any man murder LaMotte
like that, if LaMotte were not literally
<i>baring his breast</i>: parting his arms, even raising
his arms (the muscle wound shows that,
besides) in order to receive the blow?”</p>

<p>The image of a victim coöperating with his
slayer was too much for the law. The discomfort
of my analysis struck Mr. Gavegan
as an impertinent invasion. He barred it with
laughter. I could see his thought in his
mouth and his eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>“—These scientist cranks.”</p>

<p>I went on: not knowing, again, if my motive
was to convince or was bravado in the certainty
that my man was beneath convincing.</p>

<p>“Gavegan, have you ever noted the subtle
stigmata of the hypnotic trauma?”</p>

<p>Gavegan grumbled.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, sir, I’ll be havin’ to let you go.
The Coroner’s cormin’ again. We always likes
to be hospitable to the big doctors at the Institutions,
whenever we can help ’em in their
studies.” He pulled a huge silver timepiece
from his vest, and went to the window, and
looked out.</p>

<p>I was immersed so fully, that even now my
action did not make my mind break in amaze
from the rhythm of events. The big man was
at the window looking out: for he believed he
had heard the Coroner’s car, and doubtless this
meant that his night’s work was over and he
could go to his wife. I moved unhesitant to an
open door that led into a little passage. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
strip of blue carpet covered the floor. And
naked-clear there lay on it a white envelope
which I picked up and put into my pocket.</p>

<p>I thanked Gavegan: gave him two cigars,
and left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span></p>

<h3><i>h</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN I reached my rooms, Mrs.
Mahon was there with my breakfast
tray, and wondering what could have taken
me out so early. Mrs. Mahon was the Italian
widow of an Irish policeman. I sat down to
my fruit, and her ample and unsubtle beauty
was pleasant to my mood, so that I held her
with words. Mrs. Mahon loved to talk with
me: but in her sense of my state she was
shrewd, and she had never intruded her wide
hard rondures and the brash clarities of her
mind upon my silence. She stood over me now,
with her bare arms crowding her bosom, and
told me of the latest misdeeds of her lover.
Mrs. Mahon was beautiful, and to me entirely
without charms. Her head was small, the
black hair massed low on the blandness of the
forehead, and her nose was Roman. Her eyes
bore out my fancy of the moment, that she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
not flesh; for in their heavy facets was no
expression. The mouth was long and quiet.
Its sensuality seemed a deliberate trait, somehow
not born of her own flesh but of the will
of the artist who had made her. Finally, her
body as I could sense it under the loose white
fabric of her gown, was an arrangement of
obvious feminine forms: high breasts, stomach
and hips subdued: and yet to me devoid of the
mystery of her sex. She was the body unlit,
goodly and functioning: the sacrament of
flesh without the spirit. So this day it was
cool nourishment to look at Mrs. Mahon, to
drink in her clarities, to convince myself that
she was not sculpture, quite the opposite: <i>real</i>.</p>

<p>The tang of the grapefruit, the earthy pungence
of the not too fresh eggs, the bite of the
coffee, merged with Mrs. Mahon: and I was
happy in a deep forgetfulness. I was sleepy.
The thought came:—You have had a bad
dream. Your visit to the body may be real:
but you can wipe it out like a dream. It need
have no consequence in the real world. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
that is the trait of the dream, is it not? the one
trait that shuts dream out from other planes
of life? And I chatted with Mrs. Mahon, and
gave her advice.</p>

<p>“His misdeeds,” I said, “save you from ever
being bored by him. You should be thankful.”</p>

<p>She smiled: “Oh, I guess he’s a man: and
I guess I’m a woman. I suppose I get him
sore, too, sometimes, just because my ways are
them of a woman. And yet, if I wasn’t a
woman, and if he wasn’t a man——”</p>

<p>“Precisely, Mrs. Mahon. What you’ve just
said is philosophical and deep.”</p>

<p>She shook her head at my solemn words
which, I judged, tickled her as the prickings of
a poignard might titillate an elephant. She
went out with my tray, and the thought
“Rome” came to me as I watched her perfect
carriage: the low spacing of her feet, the swing
of her hips, the breadth of her back, and the
little head so rightfully proportioned, like a
rudder steering the life that dwelt within her
body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>—Rome. How far I am from Rome. How
sweet Rome would be, with its sure shallow
strength.</p>

<p>I lit a pipe. Melancholy and the hint of
an old anguish wiped out Mrs. Mahon.—This
anguish is what moves me, moves me toward
what seems the cause of the anguish. A paradox
that is a common law. Look at love: how
pain of unfulfillment moves us upon the
loved one, and as we come ever closer, ever
deeper and more absolute grows the pain of
unfulfillment. If I could analyze what this is
that has taken me: if I could only know where
it began.... But I know that it must first
fill out its life ere my mind measure it. What
did my poor analysis avail me? How wisely
I announced: “Your anguish moves you toward
the source of your anguish. You cannot
stay still because you must fulfill your own
beginning.” And how blindly I moved!</p>

<p>I reached into my pocket and took out the
envelope that I had not yet examined, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
Mrs. Mahon had helped me to forget. It was
addressed</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="large"><i>Philip LaMotte, Esquire</i></span><br>
<br>
<span class="indentright"><i>By Bearer</i></span></p>

<p>and it was in the straight high script of Mildred
Fayn!</p>

<p>It was empty.</p>

<p>I tapped it against my open palm and wondered
why I felt that it had any bearing on the
case. There was no proof that this was the
alleged letter of the fatal messenger. On the
contrary, how could I entertain a thought that
would implicate Mildred in this horrible
affair? What was I trying to find, or to
think? I was abhorrent to myself. Doubtless,
Mildred had written more than once to
a man so close. My reason flayed my miserable
thoughts: but did not break them: did
not avail against their issuance in deed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>I telephoned to Mildred.</p>

<p>“Yes?” she answered and her frail voice
bloomed out of the wire, drenching my sense
in a languor of desired peace.</p>

<p>“Mildred,” I said, “doubtless these days you
would prefer not to see me.” She did not answer
this. “But something possibly important
has come up: I feel that I should speak to
you.”</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>“Meet me at lunch, at Sherry’s ... at one-thirty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span></p>

<h3><i>i</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">MY work took me. I worked well. Doctor
Isaac Stein’s warm voice startled
me at my shoulder.</p>

<p>“You have a fine power of concentration,
Doctor Mark. I’ve been here five minutes
watching your immobile absorption.”</p>

<p>I turned and met the gray eyes of the
great bio-chemist: of the man whom of all
Americans I admired most.</p>

<p>“It is the contrary of concentration. My
brain is split in two. And the one part does
not trouble the other.”</p>

<p>He nodded and frowned.</p>

<p>“It’s the part of your brain which dwells so
voluptuously with those ganglions, that interests
me.”</p>

<p>“I stand rebuked, sir.”</p>

<p>“You’ll learn that the other part which you
think now so worthily engaged in speculation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
and in rhapsody, is merely the part not yet in
solution—not at the point yet of true condensation.
When you’re wholly crystallized, Mark,
then you’ll be <i>whole</i>.”</p>

<p>“You disapprove of me, Doctor Stein?”</p>

<p>He laughed. “You should know better
than that.”</p>

<p>“You have the passion for unity of your
race, sir.” I laughed back. “This faith in
unity which your science posits is itself the
creation of a wild mystic rhapsody.”</p>

<p>“It is the premise of every human thought,
of every human act.”</p>

<p>“—That has survived, since it fitted into the
unitary scheme. But is there not something
arbitrary about that, Professor Stein? Two
intense single-minded peoples, the Greeks and
the Hebrews, set up a scale of consciousness
based on the Unit, and narrow down the multiverse
to that. Everything that men did or
thought must fit that scale of One, be translated
into it: everything that failed was rejected,
was unrecorded, hence intellectually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
was nonexistent. To-day, after three thousand
years of this sort of selection, we have quite
an array of theory, data, thought, all in the
key of One: we have a whole civilization based
on One, a whole set of religions tuned in One,
to which our senses as well as our minds submit
and finally conform. What does that
prove beyond the thoroughness of the Greeks
and Hebrews? of their initial will to throw out
all contrary evidence, to deny all dimensions
beyond it?”</p>

<p>“Could this premise of the Unity have
builded up so wholly the structure of science,
æsthetic, logic ... the structure of human
action, were it but an arbitrary premise that
might be replaced by others at least as valid?”</p>

<p>“The strength of the limited, Doctor Stein:
the protection of exclusion.”</p>

<p>Doctor Stein’s eyes sharpened.</p>

<p>“Very well. Then, does not the success of
this premise, which you call limiting and protective,
prove that it expresses perfectly the
human essence? The fact that by means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
the premise of unity man is beginning to master
life, does that not prove, besides, that man’s
essence and the essence of being are common
terms, permitting a contact after all between
the subjective and objective, between the phenomenal
and the absolute?”</p>

<p>“You are assuming the success, Doctor
Stein! And you are assuming that this thing
which man is ‘mastering’ is life: is something
more than the creation of the subjective will
which started with the Unit that it finds
everywhere and thereby ‘masters’ ... finding
and mastering only and always itself.
You are assuming that every day is not compounded
of events which transcend the powers
of unitary logic and unitary experience even
to conceive them. How do we get out of the
difficulty? From these parabola shapes that
are the events, perhaps, of every day, our
minds snatch down the fragmentary intersections
that touch the terms of our minds. The
rest is ignored. Your ‘success’ of biology,
mathematics, chemistry, physics, æsthetics,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
mechanics, is simply your own dream, complacently
rounded by your unitary will. Unchallenged,
for the most part, for the simple
reason that long ago man’s mind has lopped
off whatever might have challenged.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, even you will admit that the
human will is unitary.”</p>

<p>“And what does the will cover? how successful,
how potent is the human will? If it were
not deeply at variance with Life, would our
will make mostly for anguish and for failure?
Would it not be a bit more competent than it
is? Would history, social and personal, not
be a happier story?”</p>

<p>Professor Stein’s eyes were hot.</p>

<p>“Come up some evening, Mark: any evening
when I’m in town: we’ll go into this.”</p>

<p>He left me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span></p>

<h3><i>j</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">CLASPING Mildred’s hand in the
pied lobby, I touched a warm, proud
sorrow. She was changed ... deepened
rather. In her great eyes, a new limpidity:
and more than ever the counterpoint of her
bright hard body and of her spirit, dark and
profoundly still, gave to her a beauty almost
beyond my bearing.</p>

<p>I gripped myself. I silenced my clamoring
question: “Mildred, Mildred, did you love
him, then?” We sat, touching our food, saying
no word, until I had mastered myself.</p>

<p>When I was able to speak:</p>

<p>“I went to his place this morning, and they
let me in.”</p>

<p>Her eyes rose to mine and dwelt there
quietly.</p>

<p>“I saw his face, dead. Even in death it was
noble. He must have been a great man, Mildred.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>Her eyes assented, serenely.</p>

<p>I made my eyes see only the loveliness of
this girl: but perhaps my mouth trembled with
a jealous pain.</p>

<p>“John,” she answered both my eyes and my
mouth, “you are suffering too. You are afraid
Philip’s death has given him an advantage over
you—a sort of perfection easier to love than
your own struggling life. That’s not true,
John. Would I lunch with you in this gay
place to-day, not twenty-four hours after his
death, if I responded in such a foolish way
to life? You are very dear to me, John: I
know that also.”</p>

<p>I could not speak. So I took from my
pocket the envelope and gave it her, in silence.</p>

<p>She examined it, turning it about. Her
eyes met mine fully:</p>

<p>“How amazing! How amazing!” she whispered.
“Where does this come from?”</p>

<p>“I found it on the floor not far from where
he lay. It might have been nearer, or have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
blown from its place on the desk. For the
windows were open. Why is it amazing?”</p>

<p>“Why? Because it is my hand. And because
I did not write it.”</p>

<p>“Mildred, for the sake of our reason, be sure
of what you say. You must have written more
than once to Philip.”</p>

<p>She paused: her teeth bit hard in her lower
lip, a tremor of resolve pushed up to her sharp
shoulders. Then, in a quiet containment, she
answered me.</p>

<p>“I make no mistake, John. I did write, infrequently,
to Philip. I never sent him a note
by messenger. If I needed to communicate
with him quickly, I telephoned, or I wired.”</p>

<p>In her pause, the gilt bustle of the room
where we were lunching, the room itself, became
a shallow and unreal line upon some
darkling density about us. Mildred went on:</p>

<p>“This is a fine version of my hand. But
it is not my hand. And there is more superficial
evidence than my conviction, that it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
not mine. <i>Did you notice the envelope</i>,
John?”</p>

<p>Her hand on the table with its débris of
crystal and porcelain and silver was steady:
mine, taking the paper, trembled.</p>

<p>I looked, and my soul blanched: my hands
seemed to crumple and collapse about the
flimsy paper. I fumbled at the flap. There
was the same lining of green tissue, and the
name embossed in tiny letters ... <i>Tissonier</i>
... the Paris stationer from whom I had
bought my stock! How could I have failed to
notice this before? this fine baronial envelope
and the tinted tissue lining which I liked because
it gave to the sheer white linen an undertone
of privacy symbolic of what an envelope
should carry.</p>

<p>“It’s my envelope! It’s one of my envelopes!”</p>

<p>I faced Mildred’s eyes: and I was whole
again, for in her own there was no withdrawal,
no banal suspicion marring their bestowal.
She spoke, and lightly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“Could there be some simple explanation?”</p>

<p>“There must be.”</p>

<p>She smiled: for she knew that my response
proved I had understood the caress of her
own thoughts. Oh, Mildred, how I loved you
at that moment, how unbelievably pure stood
your spirit in my mind, and how I quailed
to think that these mists of blindness and
blood should mar your dwelling in my life and
the sweet entrance of my life in yours.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” she was saying while I longed
for peace ... peace with my love: “Let’s
put our heads together.... It is my writing,
forged. It is your envelope, stolen. We can
dismiss the possibility of someone else just
within our circle having my hand, and having
gone to just that <i>papeterie</i> in Paris for his
correspondence paper. I suppose your stationery
is accessible enough?”</p>

<p>“It stands in an open pigeonhole in the base
of my table.”</p>

<p>“John, do you know anyone who knows both
me and Philip ... some possible person?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>I had to be equal to her coolness: this was the
very wine of my love that she was perpetually
in her moods and acts inspiring me to a new
height of conduct.</p>

<p>“I can think of no one. Of course, that
remark is worthless: there might be such a
person without my knowing it. But where
would the motive be in stealing my envelope
and forging your script upon it? The whole
complex act strikes me as stupid: a gratuitous
elaboration in no way fitting the simplicity of
the murder. Just look, Mildred. A man announces,
when he knows Mr. LaMotte to be
alone, that he is the bearer of a message. He
does not say, from whom. He would not be
expected to say: for if the message is confidential,
the name of the sender will not be
transmitted over the telephone. What comes
next? He is in the presence of his victim; if
he has a letter at all, its purpose is already
fulfilled in the act of handing it over. At that
moment must come the blow. I can see a
reason in his having forged your hand. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
LaMotte’s interest would be greater, opening
the note. In his engrossment, the assassin
would have an easier field for his work.”</p>

<p>“More than engrossment. Amazement.
Philip finds in the envelope no note at all.
He finds a word from me in such strange hands ... and
no note.”</p>

<p>“That is true. It would be enough to bewilder:
to stun. That is important. But why
my envelope?”</p>

<p>“Well, it <i>is</i> your envelope?” she smiled
again.</p>

<p>“I feel certain of it.”</p>

<p>“There must be a reason. Possibly to attach
suspicion to yourself?”</p>

<p>“A clumsy way, Mildred. A clumsy thing
to do since I never met the man. Besides, the
envelope lies on the floor of a passage where
the police failed even to find it. The murderer
would not have bungled there after his
perfect blow. The envelope would have been
in the victim’s hand if it was to serve as a false
clew.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“You are assuming perfection in the murderer,
John. That does not strike me as correct.
If he’d been perfect he’d have left no
clew at all ... and he was seen, seen clearly.
Therefore, he is not perfect. Therefore, illogic
might enter in: even contradiction—even
absurd elaboration.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” I was thinking of my talk with
Doctor Stein. Where had my sudden words
sprung from?—Perfection ... illogic ... contradiction:
Mildred went on:</p>

<p>“You can’t assume that this act is a perfect
single whole, with no excrescence, no alien
details.”</p>

<p>I marveled at her.</p>

<p>“A man so perfect as to murder perfectly
would not murder at all.”</p>

<p>“Go on.”</p>

<p>“Not murder Philip LaMotte.”</p>

<p>“Go on.”</p>

<p>“The fact that he needed to destroy a person
so noble, so great, proves his own imperfection:
proves that there was a flaw in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
him; a flaw of bad thinking, a flaw of impure
action. By that flaw you will find him.”</p>

<p>“Mildred, you mean that it is precisely in
some act of his which we who are not murderers
would reason could not have been committed,
that we will find him?”</p>

<p>“That you will find him, John.”</p>

<p>“I?”</p>

<p>“I think you will look for him, John.”</p>

<p>“Not we?”</p>

<p>“I cannot look for him, John. But I feel
that you will look for him ... and you are
going to find him.”</p>

<p>So quietly she spoke: almost so pleasantly:
again I knew how in her perfection there
could be room not alone for no fear, even for
no emphasis. She had the ruthlessness of
purity. And I was caught in it: held now
forever in the white fierce light of her exaction.
Would I burn in it? or grow luminous?
Would I grow luminous first, and burn at
last?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>So quietly she spoke: “I feel that you will
find him.”</p>

<p>And I was quiet, too. I had resolved to tell
my whole experience: in the street at the hour
of Philip LaMotte’s death, in his room this
morning where his wound had told so mysterious
a tale. Her way silenced me. She did
not want to enter, in her own person, this
dark threshold. Was she commanding me to
proceed for her, or was she expressing her
impersonal knowledge of what I was going to
do? It mattered little. I knew the event
chained me. I knew that she knew what I
was going to do. Perhaps when I saw light
I might know also why.</p>

<p>But she was sitting near, and this was real.
In her face lay a warm flush: the glamor of
her mouth and of her skin and hair was heightened
by a dark suffusion from her eyes. Mildred
was nearer to maturity. A new reticence
held her within herself. There upon her face
I saw what I had seen before upon the face
of a woman newly loving, or of a woman pregnant:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
a secret pride darkling her glory from
the world and giving to her beauty, whose like
I knew not, the magic of apartness.</p>

<p>So full I was of forbidden questioning that
I sat silent and watched her. What in her
flesh was this dawn-like pregnancy? Was it
love? love then for whom? If it was love for
me would her new fending off have been
against myself? If it was love for Philip—murdered
Philip—would it not glow like sunset
rather than like dawn?—You are a mystery,
too, sitting so graciously apart in this
harsh public place with its angular colors and
its shallow shapes. Mystery mothers me: I
must be born once more from a mysterious
womb.</p>

<p>—I cannot even say: Mildred, I love you.
You do not dismiss me but you hold me off....
Now she chatted. She was in no way
broken. And I saw how great her confidence
in me, since she looked with her candid eyes
in mine that would have quailed, had hers
found falsehood there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>—No, you believe in me. And chatting here
so bright within this whirling social dust, you
sheathe for me a knowing that is tender!</p>

<p>Mildred gives me her hand on the street
steps.</p>

<p>“Good-by, John. I hope I shall soon see
you.”...</p>

<p>Behind her the day’s Spring fades. The
sky is pale blue and the houses faint softly
as she goes, taking my hope along. Hope
is not dead, but it is in her hands. Do her
hands know? Is she too a mere symbol like
myself, of this mystery that twirls us? Yesterday
I was my center: my will was a solid
thing, impervious and young: a true thing, I,
with a true world for my willing. Now I
am snatched like an atom upon some cosmic
dance. Life is a spiraling and a plunging beyond.
And all I see, myself and Mildred
clearest, plunges along.</p>

<p>Spring poured its first bold colors down the
Avenue. In women’s dresses and mouths, in
the eyes of men, in the taut caper of horses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
in children’s laughter, Spring flowed up and
down like a warm stream between the thawing
houses. I went along. But as I walked, it
was as if I went scarce ankle-deep in this shallow
human water. My body rose above the
house banks and my head moved dark beyond
Spring, beyond sun....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span></p>

<h3><i>k</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT last came an hour when I could bear
my room no more. Every moment not
engaged at the Laboratory I had passed there.
Mrs. Mahon brought me food, and barred
from me the world of newspapers and visitors
and letters. I ate fruit and drank milk and
gave up my tobacco. A gray cloth hung upon
my book shelves, so that the deep associations
of the titles should not distract me. At the
Institute, I spoke to no one: I localized my
work to its immediate details and stopped at
that. The eyes of Doctor Stein, warm as
soon as they beheld me, studied me first and
then withdrew even from such delicate obtrusion.
I was alone with my thoughts ...
whatever they were: alone with myself, whoever
that might be.</p>

<p>At the end of fourteen days I faced the
chaos of my mind. I had succeeded in pushing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
close my nerves to the home of my desire
and they screamed with piercings. I had succeeded
in breaking down the barriers between
sense and impulse. The swarming congeries
of will within me, no longer a mute coil, now
in each thrust and writhe touched a quick
nerve. This plethora of response that my
nerves made to the world was an unwieldy
burden. In a scatter of impulse and desire,
my personality seemed on the verge of dissolution.
Still most deeply imbedded in my
swarming wills was the will to remain John
Mark: and was the knowledge, born of the
thwarting pause, that the invasion of my conscious
senses into these arcana must cease, if
I would not be fragmented and lost.</p>

<p>I was exhausted. I knew that this loosing of
the stuffs of my being was an advance: even
if the secret lay still beyond. I had made
penetrable an approach. Nor did I take too
seriously the protest of my self, crying in its
impenetralia against my mind’s invasion.
After all, what prize could I put on merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
continuing to be John Mark? I needed knowledge!
And if knowledge meant the snuffing
out of this ephemeral phase I named John
Mark, so be it.</p>

<p>I had been isolate in my room: reading no
word: with windows shut against the Spring
itself save at night when I slept and the invasion
of the street could without harm come
to my vagrant mind. But as the mind’s texture,
worn by the constant siege, grew loose
and its conscious and unconscious parts less
separate, I found that I had marvelous contacts
with the outer world. Along with the
chaos in my mind whereby sense touched hidden
thought, there came an outer chaos of illumination
throwing together outer act with
my own inner senses. Following within myself
some vein of instinct, I would come upon
a house miles off where a group of persons
were enwrapped in an action proceeding from
a similar desire. It was as if the mental association
of the normal man with me had become
incarnate. A scent of leather from my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
shoe brought me a vision of a horse loping
upon a hill and mounted by a cowboy. A
sudden flare of anger at my fate revealed two
swarthy foreigners in Chatham Square locked
in an ugly conflict. Soon I learned that I
could direct these vaultings of my sense to
the objective world. And then, the world of
those I knew and loved came to me. But
never deeply! A mere façade it was, of the
world outside.</p>

<p>I had no command over the hidden and
the intimate deeps. I could not see Mildred’s
thoughts nor better grasp her spirit. But almost
without effort I could know the acts of
her body, and her immediate moods.</p>

<p>Mildred was living her usual life: she was
reading and dancing and riding, and considering
a trip to Europe. I could not see her
thoughts of me: and from this I knew that
her thoughts of me were deep. The men about
her were vague shapes shadowing the envelope
of her body, no one of them piercing, no one
of them coming close.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>I knew that the newspapers had already
ceased, if not to talk, at least to shout, about
the murder of LaMotte. Nelson the serving
man had been released: there was no evidence
against him. Dull detectives continued to
shadow him and Elijah Case, the hall boy.
And when in my mind I followed one of these
gross forms, at night, I learned along with
the Law that Elijah made mysterious journeys
to a downtown office building, at the
small hours of dawn—in order to see his
mother who scrubbed floors.</p>

<p>I saw my parents at their routine of loafing.
Often a month passed without a sign from
me; they had no outer cause to worry at my
absence, nor did they worry. But now and
then I found a little dart studding my mother’s
breast, the thought of me in my mother: a
sharp and painful and infertile moment, not
deep at all since I saw it, which she soon overcame.</p>

<p>Once, and often then, I saw the gray eyes
of my beloved Doctor Stein—unfleshed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
isolate and farther apart than they were in
nature—looking down on me. They were
tender, almost like a woman’s eyes, and a
haze of moisture came in them as they strained
to focus on a point too far away or too small.
He was thinking of me, but what he thought
I could not reach....</p>

<p>Pleasanter and more willful journeys my
inchoate mind took also to the outer world.
On an evening when the rain fell sweet outside
and I was shut with my siege, I laid my
arid body on a lawn, under a tree, and drank
the evening full. I was hungry, and there in
my formless consciousness was Sherry’s and
a rich menu succulently complete in flavor,
color. But these relaxed and personal excursions
of my will could not bring Mildred. I
could not lunch with her, I could not sit with
her beneath a tree. There was no even superficial
act possible with my beloved: for her
soul’s presence, as soon as I was there beside
her, dwelt in my depth ... my hidden depth:
I could see her, only with others: lunching,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
or laughing. I could see her strong limbs
press the flanks of a horse as she galloped in
Long Island. But since I was excluded, these
visions hurt and I did not seek them. I confined
my trace of my beloved to making sure
that she was there, and well.</p>

<p>By deduction I plumbed my way ever
deeper, ever closer to the node of myself: and
I learned by elimination, what lived most essentially
within me. All of Mildred, save her
bright surfaces; all of myself in intercourse
with Mildred. I was incapable of a shallow
act with Mildred—or with my mother. Hidden,
also, the mysterious history of Philip’s
murder. Could this be that my connection
with his world was after all a morbid, sentimental,
subjective nothing? But I could not
see even Mildred’s thoughts about Philip! No:
my knowledge of his life and death dwelt in
the kernel of myself: it was the Secret: it
would not give up to my shrewd siege. And
therefore all that was enwrapped with it ...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
all deep and dear ... was also barred from
my invading sense.</p>

<p>I struggled, and I failed. Failed utterly.
I wore myself out with struggling. But what
I saw, down there, was not black darkness.
I seemed, rather, to peer into a stormy water.
Something is there! But great waves shiver
every image from beneath, and when I plunge
my eyes into the turmoil, the image goes, because
my eyes are whelmed. A looming Presence
deep in the node of myself! It is not
myself, and yet it is not another. When I
draw down to fix it, my mind ... John Mark
... shatters and scatters, and I must rise to
air, like a man half drowned.</p>

<p>This way I knew was dissolution. But I
could not know if the Presence which I felt
and sought was other than the dark womb of
Chaos.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Fourteen days.... And now this hour
of dusk when I can bear my room no longer.
The siege on the Secret may be a failure, or so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
nearly won that there is no more cause for my
stark pressure. I do not know. All I have
fought to know is hidden still, though I have
broken down many approaches. I must move:
and I have no sense if I am going toward my
goal or if I am retreating.</p>

<p>But to sit still another hour is impossible.
Perhaps I am to die: perhaps I am to admit
that I have failed: perhaps I lay my hand at
last on a Secret deadlier than death! All these
things may be, this alone surely: that I must
get out of my room!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span></p>

<h3><i>l</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">SPRING is a grimace when one’s heart is
gray.... Men and women coming from
work: in eyes and mouths the sprites of Spring
peer forth at the white clouds. Washington
Square is a well of muddy life, and its trees are
young girls dancing at the brink ... dangerously
close their tinkling hands to the suck and
grime of the depths. Sixth Avenue is a long
and hollow passage where flows the bilge of
New York. Spring cannot hunch low enough
to enter. I choose Sixth Avenue. For when
one’s heart is gray, Spring is a grimace....</p>

<p>I am almost cheered by this contrast. I
am hungry. I turn east once more: in the
Brevoort café I order a good dinner. I cannot
eat. The mirrors, the hard floor, the so
deliberately joyous guests are not Spring, are
brittle pasts of Spring, specimens of Spring
long dead, preserved in alcohol. Spring hurts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
yet it is fecund: it may come nearer to my
exiled heart if I am not afraid to be hurt.</p>

<p>I walk back toward Sixth Avenue. My
long siege of myself seems to be over and
to have left me nothing. I am a little light of
head, being so light of stomach, but my mind is
taking on its normal compartmental tightness,
its normal limits: its normal weakness: even its
normal satisfactions.</p>

<p>—Is the spell over? And have I dreamed
that Mildred sent me on a crazy quest? <i>I
could see her to-night!</i> And if a ghost of that
horror still remained, would we be aware of it,
warm in the sweet flesh of our love?—O Mildred,
I am weary, and I hunger. Take me.
Wrap me away. Make me wholly man by being
wholly woman.</p>

<p>I know this pang of will against its own
inevitable surge. I have passed a phase. But
Mildred is not yet there: nor can I reach her
heart save through the heart of myself. I
must go on.... The Secret!</p>

<p>Sixth Avenue. Rattle of trains like dry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
words in a mouth obscene with secrecy. Why
do I walk Sixth Avenue again, since I was
going to dare the hurt of Spring? I stop,
a small sign in a second-story window holding
me:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Landsdowne</span></p>

<p>... A modest sign ... and a late afternoon
at the Institute in Winter. Four of us
in our aprons chatting, smoking, the day’s
work done. The windows are black already
with the night, shutting in snugly warmth and
fire with us. Ford, whose work is closest to
my own, Ford speaks:</p>

<p>“There’s one of them, of all I’ve tested, just
one, has authentic power. An inscrutable hag
from London. No incense, no scenery, no
occult traps. And no sentiment, no gush.
That’s why she’s poor, I suppose. Women
pass her up for a picturesque liar. A prophetess
who’s not a prima donna, wherever she is,
is in a wilderness. But she is tremendous.
Mrs. Landsdowne, her name.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>A dingy vestibule, a double row of plates,
brass on chipped plaster, woodwork greasy
brown.... As I press sharp on the bell ...
the gas light was low in a shade dim with dirt
... I hope there is to be no answer. No
answer. I turned to go. The door clicks like
a word, ordering me about. The hall is black
reek. I stumble on the stairs.</p>

<p>At the first triangular landing, crimson
carpet strip, two doors formed the legs. I
passed them to mount still higher. The left
door opened and a narrow form stood framed
in the gap. I saw a long hand, I saw eyes.</p>

<p>They looked at me and the hand widened
the gap of the door. The door shut me in with
blackness and with her whom I knew there beside
me.</p>

<p>I could feel her move down the corridor. I
followed. Her footsteps were like gray in the
hall’s black hush. I did not hear my own.</p>

<p>A portière parted, we stood in a large room
flush with the rails of the “L”. Between the
brown bare floor and the plaster above that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
dipped and swelled a bit about the chandelier,
the furniture stood sheer: dimensional impacts
within the cave-like air. A long table faced
the windows. On its either side was a chair
upholstered red. In the corner was a piano
and on the stool, twirling about to face us, sat
a boy. He was thin and white. He arose.
Mrs. Landsdowne twined a boney arm about
his shoulder.</p>

<p>“This is a son of mine,” she broke her
silence. The white creature glanced away
from her dark thrust ... passed me ... the
portières seemed not to part for him but to
blot him out in an eclipse.</p>

<p>The chandelier was not lighted. A student’s
lamp cast a pale flush on the table. A train,
crowding of steel and wheel and wood, avalanched
past: by it the hollow room with its
dense things was lifted into dance, a moment’s
frenzy that died down, leaving the room a
pregnant atmosphere for this sharp woman.
She drew down the shades, she took the seat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
nearer the window; she waved me to face her
in the chair across the table.</p>

<p>I saw her: I asked myself if her protracted
silence was designed that I might see her, or
that she see me.</p>

<p>“John Mark,” she murmured, “John Mark.
That is clear. And a zigzag route your coming,
strange for a sober and determined man.
But you’re not sober. Drunk with thought
and with fasting. Down from a street that
is east to an open Square. What draws you,
drives you ... a cloud on the open Square.
Zigzag. West ... north ... east ... north
... west. Wandering. A crucifix of pain
rising from that smoke of the open Square.
North and south, the tree: west and east your
arms. You dangle. Such young flesh! Why
did you come here?”</p>

<p>Her arms were folded on her sunken breast.
A black silk shawl glossed the sharp shoulders
and was caught in an old breast-pin, garnet
and enamel. Her throat was bare. And from
a face, ashen and chiseled close by all the steels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
of fate, her eyes now turned on me. Their
heaviness made the brow almost a girl’s, made
the mouth a gash with blood dry for lips. The
hair lay a black coil over the brow: hair and
eyes burned in an ashen desert face.</p>

<p>“Why did you come here?” came her voice
again.</p>

<p>“You who have found my name must find
that, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is a mere ... surface. I have
not gone into you, sir. I am not sure that
I care to.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Landsdowne, you must!”</p>

<p>Her eyes began to focus far behind my own,
so that their traversing mine took on an imperturbable
coldness.</p>

<p>“Why have I come here? Surely it was not
chance: this zigzag route.”</p>

<p>“You know there is no chance. I have no
name for it: I see your mind tracing a design
out of a swarm of myriad living gray things.
Strange! They are like cells of our flesh, but
they have space about them. They swing like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
stars! You are the sort who knows ... why
have <i>you</i> come here?”</p>

<p>I clasped my hands together. I was very
tired. Yet as I looked on this woman life
seemed more bearable to me, than it had been
for long. My clasped hands cupped my falling
head. I was very sleepy, and there were
tears in my eyes.</p>

<p>I looked up at last from my sweet indulgence,
and a horror in the face of the woman
dried my tears.</p>

<p>“Will you speak, Mrs. Landsdowne, will
you speak to me?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Coward!” I cried. “Coward!”</p>

<p>Her hands hollowed and passed over her
eyes.</p>

<p>“I am not a coward,” she said.</p>

<p>“I want to know.”</p>

<p>“I am not a coward. But I am afraid.”</p>

<p>“Are you afraid of a murderer, Mrs. Landsdowne?”</p>

<p>She smiled. Her eyes resumed their distant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
focus and she smiled. She shook her head.
I leaned forward, then:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Landsdowne,” I whispered, “am I
that?”</p>

<p>Her lips stirred: the hand above her brow
twitched: she was trying to speak.</p>

<p>“No ... and worse....”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Landsdowne, I must know!”</p>

<p>“You want to know?” And now she was
laughing with her blood dark lips: and her
eyes were stiff in amaze.</p>

<p>“What horror is this I have done? How
could I?... Have you merely caught my
madness?”</p>

<p>... Her stiff eyes on me.</p>

<p>“How could I murder him with my body
absent, with my mind innocent? Are we both
mad, Mrs. Landsdowne? I want to know!
God, have I not crucified myself to know?
What have I done?”</p>

<p>“<i>What are you doing now?</i>”</p>

<p>The words were terrible to me. They came
low and calm, it was as if her eyes were speaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
in their stiff amaze. But her words released
a chaos in my flesh. My nerves in panic
rushed in myriad ways, so that my flesh seemed
a delirium of motion.</p>

<p>“<i>What are you doing now?</i>”</p>

<p>I arose. Faintness spread like a death from
my heart, and I sank back in my chair.</p>

<p>“What am I doing now?... Will you
help me to know? Will you help me to save
me?” I pleaded: my shred of energy forced
into voice.</p>

<p>She laid her hands upon the table.</p>

<p>“You will know, John Mark.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, now.”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you. But I will help you to
know.”</p>

<p>“Tell me. Tell me.”</p>

<p>She shook her head: “You will know what
you have done. One can know only that which
has been done.”</p>

<p>“How can you be so ruthless? This godless
horror——”</p>

<p>“It is not godless, Doctor Mark.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“I am not godless?”</p>

<p>“Why, no. Of course not, Doctor Mark.”</p>

<p>“But it is horror. It is horror even to
you....”</p>

<p>“It is not godless. Go home. You will
know.”</p>

<p>I pressed myself from the chair.</p>

<p>“Tell me one thing then: is it <i>human</i>?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“How do we know how many things are
human?”</p>

<p>A great lust took me then to ravish her of
her secret. I leaned over the table and I
gripped her arms. I drew her up toward me
across the table. I vised her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Tell me! Tell me!”</p>

<p>She shut her eyes, so close now to my own;
and her hands fended them.</p>

<p>Her desert face, her talonous hands were
very near my eyes. I thought of Mildred: I
had grasped her, too—to force what truth
from her?—and I had failed. I was motionless
in amaze at my cruel thought linking this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
woman with Mildred, linking my need of her
with my love for Mildred.</p>

<p>“Let go,” I heard her mutter. “Do you
want to blind me?”</p>

<p>I released her. “You have promised.” And
I laid a bill on the table.</p>

<p>“John Mark,” she said. And still her bitter
presence mingled in my mind with Mildred....
Mildred! “I cannot break the body of
your way to-night with words any more than
to-morrow can invade to-day. Each has its
place appointed. You will come upon to-morrow
waiting your way, and you will come upon
knowledge waiting your way. I am a part
of the morrow of your knowing. I cannot
break in. You have been with me, John Mark,
only as a traveler is with the distant town that
his eyes behold from a hill’s height, deep and
far on his way within the valley.”</p>

<p>She took my money and placed it in a
drawer. I held her hand gently.</p>

<p>“Why is this horror just my life?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>She shook her head, and her free hand
touched my brow in a caress.</p>

<p>“There we are all children. That ... the
one mystery worth knowing ... none of us
may know. Our eyes can study deep in the
ways of life. But God’s will ... God’s reasons....
There we are all children.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span></p>

<h3><i>m</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">SIXTH AVENUE. Unwittingly, perhaps
to place myself once more in the
world? I looked at my watch. 9.03. Only
9.03! I have swept out so far and come back,
and my watch says 9.03.</p>

<p>I turn toward home, and my steps hurry
me. Why is that? Am I running from the
black apocalypse behind, or rushing toward
some blacker revelation? I do not know: I
am encased in darkness, and that is all that
I feel. My power to touch the body of the
world, the deeds and ways of my friends, is
gone from me. I move through presentiment
of birth, as in a womb. So different from
life, this dank dark mother of my ignorance.
And yet a womb, nourishing me and pressing
me toward the light.</p>

<p>Houses, sky, the shuttling tissue of men
and women past me are the dark wall and dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
blood of a womb. I airless and immobile
within it, still believe in Birth.</p>

<p>Doctor Stein ... the revered Doctor Stein,
whose interest in me at the laboratory has so
warmed my heart, is coming down my steps.
I am beyond surprise. Within this mothering
darkness of my life words and customs and
conventions move quite nimbly. So I greet
Doctor Stein. I observe how his gentle face
is a bit clumsied by his embarrassment:</p>

<p>“I just thought I’d drop in. I knew, though
I’d said ‘Come,’ you were not coming to see
me.”</p>

<p>“Doctor Stein, I didn’t dare.... I was
afraid you’d forgotten that casual invitation.”</p>

<p>“Just so. So <i>I</i> came.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you come back, Doctor Stein?”</p>

<p>He followed me docilely, and took the chair
I pointed out for him, sprawling a bit with his
legs out, priming his pipe, and his eyes puzzled
at the curtains over my book shelves.</p>

<p>“You cover your books, when you need to
think deep?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“This time I did. I never have before.”</p>

<p>He puffed hard at his pipe, clenching the
bowl in his fist. A naïf discomfort faintly
fretted his natural ease. His fine mouth
moved, his gray thick brows lowered over his
eyes, and in his eyes there was a twinkle as if
this was a holiday for him, and he a bit rusty
at it.</p>

<p>“Oh,” I exclaimed, as the man’s playful
candor shone to me not at war but at one
with his limpid mind. “Oh, I am so glad,
so glad that you cared to drop in!”</p>

<p>“I’ve been getting up courage to come, for
a long time.” He puffed.</p>

<p>I felt no guilt as he watched me. Let this
spirit which had pierced to the soul of matter
and proved its mastery by the act of birth
... let him see me clear, as he saw everything.
He was above judging, he was a creator! If
I was this horrible enigma from which the
mankind in me shrank and for which it had no
word, let him see: he who had captured in a
formula the passion of gestation, would know,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
if he saw me clear, some law to hold me, some
law to put me back into the warmth of human
life. So I faced his eyes with open eyes.
And I basked in his intelligence, as in a sun.</p>

<p>Doctor Stein chatted. He had not come
to argue, he had come to play. He talked
of a new composer, of an Irish comedy, of a
farcical talk he had had with the Mayor who
had summoned him to serve on some Committee.
By a trick of memory, when he
reached the Great Presence, he had forgotten
the purpose of the Committee: and he scanned
His Honor’s words carefully for a hint, and
in vain.... I remarked how boyish was this
celebrated man. The slight body was fresh
and awkward: the hair uprose in a flourish
that was youth: the eyes were young: the hands
were feminine and young. His mind was like
a mellow wine within him, that with age had
grown closer to the sun and the fields. Doctor
Stein was not only young, he was naïf: he was
confident and blooming with his faith. Was
this indefeasible verdance a large part of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
greatness?... Doctor Stein wafted a great
puff of smoke into the room and laughed:</p>

<p>“I got so mixed up, what with the Mayor’s
allusions and assumptions and bad metaphors,
that I began to defend myself by mystifying
nonsense. You should have heard me. I
rolled out great sentences signifying nothing.
I made some wild statement and proved it by
half a dozen mutually contradictory points.
And His Honor nodded solemnly, and agreed.
So I went on, more daring, wilder. Once or
twice he shook his ponderous head—the weight
is chiefly in the chin and jowl—as if subtly
to dissent. It was rich! As I left, he thrust
out his hand as if it had been a bankroll. I
took it humbly. He said: ‘It’s a great honor
to me, Doctor, to coöperate with one of our
great American Minds, and to find that we are
so fundamentally in accord!’ The Professor
waved his hands in delight. ‘And you will
argue against Democracy, I suppose, you
young pedant. What else but Democracy
could put such a man in a place of power? And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
what better man for the place could we hope to
find? Surely, such clownish genius is better
for the world than all the efficient solemnity
of Germany and England. I tell you: the
American politician is as great a creation as
Rabelais or Aristophanes ever dreamed of.
Don’t you dare contradict me. America has
the comic genius.’”</p>

<p>At last he paused, and I could see his mind
go out of the window.</p>

<p>“That rain must stop,” he said. “Too heavy
to go on.”</p>

<p>I knew then that it had begun to rain immediately
after my return. It was a ponderous
downpour, pressure upon stone of a sheeting
element almost as solid. Outside the rain
was a world of thought I did not choose to
enter: here in my room was a snug apartness,
and I held to it and to the rain as the cover
over us. I held to the Doctor as to a charm
saving our sanctuary. He chatted on, again,
and I forgot all else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>He arose, he emptied his pipe of its ashes
and placed it away.</p>

<p>“It’s over,” he said.</p>

<p>Yes: the rain has ceased. And I know the
dreaded Threshold which it has barred from
me. Doctor Stein is going away, and the rain
has passed, and soon I shall be <i>within</i>. My
shoulders shuddered as if already a swart
world clapped them.... Doctor Stein placed
his hands upon them, and looked at me in
silence.</p>

<p>“Son,” he said, after the pause—and I could
hear my memory of the rain, so deep did I
fear this quiet. “Son, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>My face broke. I yearned to bury it in his
hands: I managed to smile.</p>

<p>“I don’t know ... yet.”</p>

<p>“I like you, Mark. I believe in you. I wish
I could help.”</p>

<p>My gratitude was in my eyes. But something
else was there, so that I dared not show
my gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“It is mysterious to me,” I smiled. “I seem
to have lost my unity.”</p>

<p>“You are in trouble ... and you talk metaphysics.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if my trouble were some fact!”</p>

<p>The cry of my voice impressed him. I went
on:</p>

<p>“You are so intact, so <i>one</i>; how can you heal
me? You cannot touch my pain. Even my
own mind cannot touch it. My mind, too,
like all the words I can speak, is in the world
of one: and the horror is, that part of my soul
seems to have left that world.”</p>

<p>“But you have your mind, John: draw yourself
back into the sanity of its control.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could——”</p>

<p>“The other way is dissolution.”</p>

<p>“Dissolution of a lie, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Dissolution of your personality, of your
integrity.”</p>

<p>“Man’s unity perhaps is nothing, and the
laws and logic of it: if he is but a fragment.”</p>

<p>“I can’t follow you, John. I have never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
seen broken this unity of matter. I come
always nearer to it, the more I see.”</p>

<p>“What could your mind and your eyes behold
beyond themselves? What fragment,
feeling over its own domain, could judge itself
other than the whole?”</p>

<p>“Sick,” he whispered to himself. And in
silence, he watched me. The room was gray:
the light of the lamp came horizontal to his
eyes that watched me. We were still. I felt
the silence that the rain had left.</p>

<p>Then something within his eyes that had
searched mine, quailed. A subtle tremor went
through all his body, as if in fear it yearned
to be away. He was in anguish of an impalpable
instinct, shuddering him off, and that
shamed him. He held his ground. But his
eyes were veiled with a wistful helplessness.</p>

<p>—Why don’t you go? I thought. I knew
he stayed because he would not give in to the
shudder that shamed him: and because he
wanted to understand that shudder.</p>

<p>He held out his hand. I took it, cold and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
removed. All his body was cold. Only his
eyes were warm, and in them I saw a look
kin to what I had seen in the eyes of Mrs.
Landsdowne. Doctor Stein and she ... how
could their eyes have kinship?—They have
seen one thing! Two words as different as
themselves are different. But they have seen
one thing!</p>

<p>“Will <i>you</i> tell me,” said my eyes, “before
you go, what you have seen?”</p>

<p>But he had no word for it. A gray muteness
spread upon his face, from which his eyes
stared out.</p>

<p>“John Mark,” he stammered, “your will,
John Mark—<i>what is it touching</i>?”</p>

<p>I looked at him in my helplessness.</p>

<p>—Can not you see my helplessness?</p>

<p>He answered my silence. He mastered himself
and took my hand once more. He held
it close. He was at ease and strong.</p>

<p>“I respect you,” he whispered. And he
went away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span></p>

<h3><i>n</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;SHUT the door and stood at the open
window. Blackness. No spot of light,
no twinge of movement marred the black of
the world. I was tense with an expectancy.
The black of the world was torture but I faced
it. I knew the next step would bring me full
within it: the blackness would speak. The
night....</p>

<p>The bell of my telephone. There it was!
A piercing channel to my ears, whereby the
night would speak.</p>

<p>I took up the receiver. “Yes,” I said.</p>

<p>“Hold the wire.... Long distance.”</p>

<p>Faint buzzing, piercings of sound poured
with the night into my ear.</p>

<p>“Hello.” “Yes.” “Doctor John Mark?”
“Yes.” “Is this Doctor John Mark?” “Yes.”</p>

<p>“Please hold the wire, sir. Huntington,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
Long Island ... wishes to speak to Doctor
Mark.”</p>

<p>“This is Huntington Hospital.”</p>

<p>“This is Doctor Mark.” I spoke to the
night. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“This is Dr. John Mark?” A pause.</p>

<p>“Doctor, there has been an accident. An
automobile accident. Your parents——”</p>

<p>“Are they at the hospital?”</p>

<p>“Yes, doctor.”</p>

<p>“Are they——”</p>

<p>“Better come out, sir,” said the night. I
rang off.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>... <i>What are you doing now?</i> Mrs. Lansdowne’s
voice.</p>

<p>... <i>Your will, what is it touching?</i> The
horror of Doctor Stein.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A train was pulling out. I caught it. I
had no sense other than this full immersion in
the night. And in consummation. And all of
it still a Threshold.... A taxi rushed me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
to the hospital. A tall interne with gentle eyes
came to me.</p>

<p>“Are you Doctor Mark?”</p>

<p>I nodded.—I am this night! What monstrous
irony is this, calling me by a name that
brings to gentle eyes commiseration and respect?</p>

<p>“We did what we could.”</p>

<p>“Both of them?” I spoke low, fearing an
echo in the empty hall.</p>

<p>He bowed his head and shut his lips against
the anatomical details that urged them.</p>

<p>“And Fergus, the chauffeur?”</p>

<p>“He is not in danger. He was thrown free
through the windshield. Contusions. Lacerations.
A simple fracture in shoulder and arm.
<i>They</i> were pinned in. Windows shut. It was
raining hard. Do you ... do you ... want to
see them?”</p>

<p>I shook my head. I saw them clear enough.</p>

<p>“First,” I said, “let me see Fergus.”</p>

<p>The boy lay in his high bed, bandaged: his
bruised face gleaming with a spiritual torture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
that was almost like thirst in its need of being
quenched.</p>

<p>He did not wait for the door to shut. He
shouted:</p>

<p>“It was no accident! It was foul play, I tell
you! Murder!”</p>

<p>I pressed him back on his pillow. He struggled.
So I let him half rise, knowing his need
for spiritual quenchment more dangerous than
his wounds.</p>

<p>“It must have been done at the garage.
The six nuts of the left front wheel. Kill me
this instant, if it ain’t the truth. While I was
havin’ supper. Foul play it was. They left
the bolts in. Devilish. As soon as I speeded
up, on the curve, after the tracks.... It was
someone hellish. Kill me if it wasn’t. Oh—kill
me at any rate.” He plunged his face in
the pillows. He moaned. Then his pain sobered
him.</p>

<p>I wanted to soothe him with my hand. I
could not touch him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“Be quiet, Fergus. I am sure you are right.
No one is blaming you. Be quiet, I say.”</p>

<p>A fleshly gray-haired man, his smooth,
round face a daze of terror, waited at the door.
He owned the garage where my parents’ car
had stayed while they dined with friends, while
Fergus supped, while the rain fell. The man
was named Dukes. He drove me silent to the
place of the deaths.</p>

<p>The open road was washed fresh with the
rain. Clouds still hung black, and the air
blasted like wet words, clean and ominous,
against the drought of my face. We crossed
railroad tracks, and stopped.</p>

<p>“That last bump done it, sir,” said Mr.
Dukes. “Shook the bolts out. The nuts was
gone already.”</p>

<p>The car was ditched rubbish against a telegraph
post, a shut and mangled wreck. Fifty
yards beyond, also in the ditch, we found intact
the tire and rim of the left wheel, where
they had rolled together.</p>

<p>We returned to the garage. Death was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
there in the open mouths of the men, in their
blanched eyes, in the heavy hanging shadows.</p>

<p>“I’m an honest man, sir,” said Mr. Dukes
to me. “If this here was murder and has to do
with any o’ mine, I’ll see this here place which
is all I has in the world a heap of ashes before
I’ll spare myself.”</p>

<p>“What motive,” said I, “could any of your
men have had in such a thing?”</p>

<p>“None,” growled Dukes. The men’s murmur
wreathed about me, an assent that was
ready to rage into flame at the kindle of any
doubt of mine.</p>

<p>“Any boys about? Mischief-makers? Rowdies?”</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“Any strangers?”</p>

<p>A man came forward: a lean, cave-jawed
fellow with the eyes of a starved poet.</p>

<p>“There was that stranger that come askin’
fer work.”</p>

<p>He spoke not to me, but to Dukes. The men
wreathed closer to him. They felt that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
words were a healing truth. They were one,
sustaining him in what he was ready to say.</p>

<p>“’Bout 8.30 it was or 9.00. While that car
was here.”</p>

<p>The man was eloquent: quietly sure of himself,
as if the assent of his fellows transfigured
his words.</p>

<p>“He come to the floor and he says: ‘Lookin’
fer a mechanic?’ The car was the last in, and
was goin’ out first. It was right there, next
that oil-tank. I says: ‘No chance’. ‘Well,’
says he, ‘won’t you go and ask the boss? Won’t
cost you nothin’.’ I looks at him. ‘No chance,’
I says, an’ then, sudden, surprisin’ myself, I
gives in: I says: ‘But if you wants, why—I’ll
go.’ So I leaves him.”</p>

<p>“Alone?”</p>

<p>His eyes burst at me. Then he remembered
who I was. Pity controlled his eyes.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t tell, mister. Jesus!—how could
I tell? The man looked all right. What we
got to fear, usual, ’cept somethin’ lyin’ loose
gets swiped? I wasn’t gone a minute.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>I felt sorry for him. I nodded.</p>

<p>“I come back. An’ he was standin’ there.
His hat in his hand. A funny guy, he seemed
then: like no mechanic. Sort o’ seemed I
hadn’t seen him before. I tells him: ‘Nothin’
doin’.’ I wasn’t gone a minute. He nods.
Puts on his hat. Lights out.”</p>

<p>“What did he look like?”</p>

<p>The man writhed in the effort of search and
of articulation.</p>

<p>“He was funny lookin’. Didn’t look like no
mechanic. I dunno. The light ain’t much,
you see, on the floor. He was dressed dark-like
... and ... I dunno ... seems sort o’
like his head, it was white.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span></p>

<h3><i>o</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;AM in my room. My watch says 1.30.</p>

<p>The smoke of Doctor Stein’s pipe lingers
like the fume of a spent flame that was the
life of sun and stars and earth. All of my
room is the echo of a song. It is outside me,
but my senses wistfully can touch it. I touch
my body, taking off my clothes. My body has
the flavor to my senses, not of the real but of
the reminiscent.</p>

<p>I lie in bed. The white sheets fold about
me like a dream. I switch off the lamp: blackness
moves dense upon me and within me: and
the light that is gone dwells in my memory like
a light of fancy.</p>

<p>I shut my eyes. This twisted horror, life ...
Philip murdered and my parents murdered,
Mildred grimacing their death with her fairness,
they with their horror swarming upon
Mildred.... I cannot meet it with my mind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
I am sunk in this twisted terror. Naught is
outside me for my mind to meet, save the voice
that came from the worn throat of Mrs. Landsdowne:</p>

<p>“What are you doing?... But you must go
on.... When to-morrow takes its place beyond
to-day, you will know. And I will help you
know.”</p>

<p>A flowing water, the promise of her words.
I plunge in it. I lie in it, I sleep....</p>

<h3><i>a</i></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE house stands on the height of a
mountain. I am aware of the mountain
more than of the house. The
room in which I am, in which we are, has a door
that opens on a narrow hall: and at the hall’s
end there is another room. That is the whole
of the house. Along the room’s length there
are three French windows giving upon a roofless
porch: and the slope of the mountain
starts down from the porch.</p>

<p>Our room is lighted by a single lamp that
burns on the end wall away from the wall with
the door. (I feel that the hall is dark and that
the other room is dark and that the mountain
is dark, and that the night holding the world
is dark save for our lighted room.) The walls
of our room are unpainted pine, the rafters
break and cast into wild shapes the shadow of
the lamp. The long wall opposite the windows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
is broken by no window, the lamp’s shadows
do not fall there, its wood is white. All about
is the night, for the house stands on the very
mountain crest. Night has invaded even the
hall, even the other room. And all about is
silence. The mountain sinks in silence beyond
our senses. And our senses like prisoned birds
live in this shut room where alone there is not
blackness and silence.</p>

<p>We are I and Mildred, lovely in a gown
of green that shimmers on her body like an
emerald molten by the white flame of her flesh.
We are I and Mildred and Mildred’s father,
and both my parents, and Philip LaMotte and
Doctor Isaac Stein. We are seven: brightly
at ease and talking in this silent night upon a
mountain top so high that the air about us
moves not toward earth but the spaces; so high
that these silences are bathed in a celestial prescience
free from the marring noises of men.
And straight from our room with its solitary
lamp weaving deep shadows in the ceiling’s
softness, the slope bears down dense into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
depth too vast for the penetration even of our
thoughts.</p>

<p>Mildred is touching a guitar, and she sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“As ye came from holy land</div>

<div class="verse">He is won with a world of despair,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Singing her mediæval tune, she is one with
it, and one with the silver strings that leap
from her songful fingers.</p>

<p>I watch Mildred, and Philip LaMotte by
my side watches her: Philip LaMotte and I
watch each other watching Mildred sing. We
three are closest to the other room. At the
room’s end away from us, beneath the lamp,
sit my parents chatting with Doctor Stein.
Close to the central window Mildred’s father
plays a game of solitaire.</p>

<p>Doctor Stein sits low in an easy chair with
his hands clasped on his knees and listens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
smiling to the comfortable converse of my
mother. My father leans back: he is enjoying
his cigar, and his attention is equal between the
heavy rings of smoke that he blows high, and
the pleasant words of his wife. Mr. Fayn
touches a pensive finger to his brow between
each upturn of a card. He is very serious, and
unmindful of the talk and of the music.</p>

<p>Mildred sings and ceases: her smile wreathes
a balance between us. She sings again. Doctor
Stein’s eyes twinkle at the complacence
of my mother’s words. My father’s eyes glaze
a bit as if the warm lull of the room rocked him
toward sleep. Mr. Fayn mixes his cards noiselessly,
and lays them out in silence: his feet
tap in a toy excitement as the game goes on.</p>

<p>We are at peace and warm: Mildred like
a green fountain, sends verdure and dance
quietly down the room. Philip and I, knowing
each other, quaff her loveliness. We have
enough: we are tortured by no passion. From
her fingers, from her throat, love jets a cool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
source into our lives. And beyond our eager
youth sits the maturity of the others: ironic
in Doctor Stein, complacent in my mother,
dully sensual in my father, childishly earnest
in Mr. Fayn.</p>

<p>Mother sends a word, from time to time:</p>

<p>“Mildred, that is a pretty tune. What is
it?...” and waits for no answer, remembering
some nothing to tell the Doctor. Father
frowns, turned desultorily in our direction: but
a thick puff of smoke clouds out the frown
and he is once more at ease in his flat nirvana.</p>

<p>Mildred sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“The winds all silent are,</div>
<div class="verse">And Phœbus in his chair</div>
<div class="verse">Ensaffroning sea and air</div>
<div class="verse">Makes vanish every star:</div>
<div class="verse">Night like a drunkard reels</div>
<div class="verse">Beyond the hills to shun his flaming wheels:</div>
<div class="verse">The fields with flowers are deck’d in every hue,</div>
<div class="verse">The clouds with orient gold spangle their blue;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
<div class="verse">Here is a pleasant place—</div>
<div class="verse">And nothing wanting is, save She, alas!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“But here the place is better than your
song’s. For She is here.”</p>

<p>Mildred laughs at my words.</p>

<p>“What has this place to do with the song?
That is dawn. This is night.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the dawn is coming,” Philip says.</p>

<p>“It is less rare than she. And she is already
here.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he goes on. “Dawn must come where
She is.”</p>

<p>“Dawn,” I say, “will be wonderful up here.”</p>

<p>“It will be perpendicular.... Shot up like
a flaming arrow from below.”</p>

<p>“And we will watch it fly up toward us, till
it kindles the house!” Mildred claps her hands,
letting her guitar lie in her lap.</p>

<p>“But,” Philip says, “what will become of
the night?”</p>

<p>“The night is the black deep wine in which
we have drunk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“Day will drink of it, and drink it up, and
be drunk.” Mildred laughs at Philip.</p>

<p>“Day will dance,” says Philip, “on the
mountain top.”</p>

<p>“Mildred,” I turn to her, “you ought to
know. For you are like the day standing upon
the tip of the night, and peering down on us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you two, with your fanciful prose! I
have to take refuge in music ... matter-of-fact
music.”</p>

<p>She touches her guitar.</p>

<p>“Philip,” I say, “don’t you think we can
catch the dawn soon up here?”</p>

<p>He is silent, not knowing.</p>

<p>“John, don’t be foolish,” comes my mother’s
voice. “How do you expect to see the dawn
at midnight?”</p>

<p>“But the mountain is so high.”</p>

<p>“What difference does that make? Eh,
Doctor Stein, what do you think of the foolish
ideas of my boy?”</p>

<p>“If you went high enough,” smiles Doctor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
Stein, “above the earth, you could catch dawn
at sunset.”</p>

<p>My mother tosses her head, tossing the discomfort
of the thought away.</p>

<p>Mildred’s laughter peals: “Oh, I shan’t be
satisfied till I’ve seen that.”</p>

<p>“We are high up,” ponders Philip.</p>

<p>“I have won!” shouts Mr. Fayn. “Come,
look. It’s all clear. Look!”</p>

<p>“But we believe you, Fayn.” My father
languidly blows a ring toward the rafters.</p>

<p>“And even if we aren’t so high,” says Mildred,
“perhaps we are high enough to catch the
dawn at midnight.”</p>

<p>“We are very high,” says Philip.</p>

<p>“Well,” cries Mildred, “why does no one
look? It’s midnight now. Instead of arguing,
instead of theorizing, why does not someone
look?”</p>

<p>She tosses her head up and down.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re all too comfortable, here, to
budge,” she taunts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>“And you, what about you?” says my mother
savagely, while she lights a cigarette.</p>

<p>Mildred turns toward me. I arise from my
chair.</p>

<p>“I will look for you, Mildred.”</p>

<p>All of them are seated: all of them are laughing
at my words, for even as I hear them, my
voice is solemn. What nonsense is this? I
accept as real and right this comfortable group
of laughing persons, dear to me, who mock
from the bright assurance of their world
matriced in black, my gesture as I rise to seek
the dawn at midnight.</p>

<p>“Look at him,” cries mother. “He’s really
going to look. Doctor Stein, what <i>will</i> we do
with my boy?”</p>

<p>My father sneers in his kindliest way, and
Mildred’s laughter like a precious stone says
nothing to me. But I am up from my chair....
And I am near the window.</p>

<p>“Will you know,” says Philip, “how to look
for it?”</p>

<p>I do not answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>Mr. Fayn starts another game.</p>

<p>“I’m foolish,” he announces seriously. “You
never win twice in one sitting.”</p>

<p>“There’s a good law,” says Doctor Stein,
“to break.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fayn shakes his head.</p>

<p>Mildred’s interest pierces me. Philip sits
heavy at her side, a little closer since I left
my chair.</p>

<p>Before me is the night.—Well, why not
look? Behind me, the real, the light: my dear
ones. As I move across the floor, my eyes,
ere they have looked, are heavy and are
strained.</p>

<p>“There is nothing to see.”</p>

<p>The words have come ere my eyes truly saw
if there was nothing to see. It is as if my will
spoke the words ... lying words?... My
mother nods, content. Mildred bends toward
Philip. Father smokes and Mr. Fayn taps
his foot on the floor.</p>

<p>“Will you know,” the low warm voice of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
Philip, “how to look for the dawn at midnight?”</p>

<p>“You have told us,” Mildred thrums her
guitar. “It will rise perpendicular like a flaming
arrow.”</p>

<p>“From where?”</p>

<p>“From the deep.”</p>

<p>“From the deep below the mountain.”</p>

<p>“If I see,” said I, “any signs in the blackness,
any stirring in the night, will that not be
the dawn?”</p>

<p>And as I spoke I knew that I was speaking
to help my eyes from having to look. They
held back from the night as if my body had
shrunk from plunging with them down into a
cold black sea.</p>

<p>“It might be another house, if all you saw
was a light.”</p>

<p>“No, mother,” I spoke nervously, eager to
answer every word that came lest the silence
behind me push my eyes indeed into the blackness.
“There is no other house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“There is one house on the mountain top,”
said Mildred.</p>

<p>“No house could live upon the mountain
side,” said Philip.</p>

<p>“Oh, what futile conversation,” mocked my
mother. “Really, Doctor Stein, is this all your
fault?”</p>

<p>“No house could live,” said Philip, “on the
mountain side. And no man could hold to it.”</p>

<p>“He would fall back ere he had risen a single
step.”</p>

<p>Doctor Stein soothed my mother: “Do not
blame me, Mrs. Mark. And do not blame me,
either, if someone asks next how we came
here ... high up on the impassable mountain.”</p>

<p>Mother smiled and patted his fine hand: as
much as to say “No, that foolish you are not,
dear Doctor. That foolish none of us is.”</p>

<p>And then, as they all smiled at the Doctor’s
jest, there came from all the room what I most
dreaded: silence. No more words to pull me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
back: but silence pressing against the base of
my brain, as I stood near the window.</p>

<p>I breathed at ease, for it was really darkness.
I began to exult. I prepared my words
as if to fling at them in answer to a hostile
challenge.</p>

<p>“See—there is no sign of dawn at midnight.”</p>

<p>The words were not uttered.... I forgot
the cozy room in which I stood. I saw the
night. And there was something there by
which to see it!</p>

<p>The black of the sky was limpid: a well of
blackness, a blackness that received my sight
passively, and my sight sank in it and was lost.
This sky had no cloud, and yet no moon or star.
It was a black thing enfolding me. But the
slope of the mountain was a harder blackness:
dense and wilful the mountain side struck
down athwart the mellow blackness of the sky.
My eyes went immensely far, until the vast
stroke of the mountain faded, became moltenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
one with the warm night of the sky that folded
all about.</p>

<p>Deep down where the mountain melted into
space and solid and fluid merged into a blindness,
I saw a spot of light. I was silent: and
as I held my breath, the spot of light moved
up.</p>

<p>I spoke:</p>

<p>“Something is down there ... and it is
bright ... and it is moving up.”</p>

<p>But there was no answer in the room. My
words seemed naked, almost ashamed: so
strange they sounded in the place I held between
the room and the night.</p>

<p>I turned around: they had not heard my
words. They had forgotten me. They had
forgotten their own impulse, their own words
which sent me on this errand. Even Mildred.
She thrummed her guitar and her emerald
body swayed, and her face, its opalescent smile,
beamed upon Philip, whose eyes she held in
hers. My mother was conversing low with
Doctor Stein and my father had taken a chair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
beside Mr. Fayn: they were intent together
over the cards.</p>

<p>“Something is down there ... bright ...
and it moves up.”</p>

<p>My words, first naked, now seemed disembodied.</p>

<p>—They cannot hear my words! Once more
I faced the window and the night.</p>

<p>The little light, as it grew larger, changed
from a bright glow to a vague gray. It became
less like flame, more like some substance
through whose translucent stuff a flame ran
fragilely. And as it moved up the dense
mountain slope, it seemed to limn with its
march the vastness of this world upon whose
summit stood the house: and at whose depth
lay the sky.</p>

<p>The words behind me in the room, the tap
of a foot on the floor, and Mildred’s hands
merging with the silver strings of her guitar,
lay in my ears now evanescent. The thing that
was a light, yet grayly swelling, moved up the
slope of the mountain. The room with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
words and its music and its laughter became a
tinkle of gilt beside this gorgeous silence. And
in the silence moved the light thing up.</p>

<p>I see it clear.</p>

<p>“Something was down there ... and is
moving up ... something convolved and
gray. Some Thing....”</p>

<p>Now they heard me. And in the stillness
of their mouths I heard their bodies rise, and
move across the floor, take place beside me. I
saw on either side of me their eyes, peering
with mine into the silent night.</p>

<p>The gray light Thing was flowing up the
mountain. It had a simple motion up the
slope, simple and straight. Within itself it
had another motion, intricate and convolved.
In its gray translucence, forms swarmed and
writhed upon themselves: contorted, funneling,
in permutation. But they were held to a
unity of interaction, making them simply one
in their approach, like the bewildered parts of
some body disarrayed by magic, that writhed
and twisted to fall back into measure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>The Thing was a penetrant glow within the
night, tracing the night of the slope, tracing
the night of the sky. The writhing parts of
the Thing writhed closer, moved more sluggish,
densened, grew white: a white form
merged from the chaotic whirl. The Thing
was almost abreast us. It was solid. It was
the form, translucent and still with a vaporous
glow about it, of a youth.</p>

<p>He moves up toward us. The amorphous
maze from which he has condensed is now an
aura. He moves up from the right, he crosses
the front vision of our eyes. He is very near,
bearing leftward toward the house, yet slantwise
so that he will not touch our room.</p>

<p>A youth, straight, rhythmic, with his profile
sharp and his mouth a shadow in the white
of his face, and his eye an impalpable fire.
His hair is a tangle of shadows like the last
embers in a hearth. Now he is white, dazzlingly
crystalline, across the black of the
night, across the gaze of our eyes!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>He passes bearing toward the left. He
disappears.</p>

<p>Mildred speaks:</p>

<p>“He has gone into the other room.”</p>

<p>And all of us, not knowing how we know,
know she speaks the truth.</p>

<p>We turn about and see each other, and rejoice
seeing ourselves so palpable in the warm,
shut room.</p>

<p>“He is in the other room.”</p>

<p>“The hall is long, and the door is shut that
leads into the other room.”</p>

<p>My mother moves to the door. As she puts
her hand on the key she shudders. It is a terrible
thing for me to see the lovely and proud
flesh of my mother broken in a shudder. But
she turns the key. She moves, as if blown
by a wind, back to among us.</p>

<p>“Now it is locked,” she says.</p>

<p>We are solid and warm in the room that is
locked.... Mildred is looking at me; I feel
her eyes, and do not want to meet them.</p>

<p>I am afraid to meet them.—Mildred, what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
now is in your eyes as in your voice that sent
me to spy on the night?</p>

<p>Sudden, from the silence, they all speak ...
all save Mildred and me.</p>

<p>“Well, we have locked the door,” my mother
says.</p>

<p>“What have we seen?” says father. “I have
heard no one say what we have seen. We
have seen nothing.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get back,” says Mr. Fayn, “to our
game.”</p>

<p>“These phenomena,” warns Doctor Stein,
“are beyond our grasp. Doubtless because
they are the mere reflections of perfectly clear
phenomena. We try to grasp the reflections,
and of course we fail.”</p>

<p>They are cool and calm, and determined.</p>

<p>“Well—whatever—we have locked the
door.”</p>

<p>Philip is passionate. He has forgotten all
else. He is alone with his love.</p>

<p>“Mildred,” I hear him call. I turn, and I
meet Mildred’s eyes at last. Philip’s hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
clasp her wrists that are tender like the stems
of a long flower. Her face is close to his, her
body is close to his: but her eyes touch mine.</p>

<p>“Mildred, my love—Mildred!” murmurs
Philip. Her wrists lie in his hands and her
face is near his lips. But her eyes are steadfast
on me.</p>

<p>“In the other room?” I ask, as if corroborating.</p>

<p>Her eyes do not move. I nod. And I say:</p>

<p>“I am going to the other room, to see.”</p>

<p>Philip’s hands do not stir in their tender
clasp. But my mother, who was once more
seated, jumps to her feet.</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Why?” ... The others merely turn and
look.</p>

<p>“What folly!”</p>

<p>“And what for?”</p>

<p>Mildred’s eyes are on my eyes. I am happy.
Her eyes do not know that Philip’s hands are
on her hands. I want only her eyes. Her
face is white in its gold maze of curls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>I pass her. I turn the key of the door back
in the lock. I face about with my hand upon
the doorknob.</p>

<p>—Why do they let me go so easily?</p>

<p>For they have not protested more. Their
will is shallow: quickly they are at the end of
their will. Mother’s thoughts steal back to
her easy chair and to her cigarette and to
her badinage with Doctor Stein. Father has
pulled two huge cigars from his case which
he claps shut: he offers one to Mr. Fayn who
takes it. In Philip’s eyes, there is a growing
gayety of promise as he looks at the milkwarm
skin of Mildred.</p>

<p>The hurt of their shallow will moves me to
lightness. It is as if, in asserting for myself
the inconsequence of what I am to do, their
negative permission will become less cold and
cruel.</p>

<p>“I’ll not be long,” I say: my voice sounds
high. “I’ll be back ... never fear ... I’ll
be back.”</p>

<p>Mildred’s eyes for the first time leave mine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
as if my words released them. She looks at
Philip. She is very close to him, and her face
upturns to his. Her little breasts alert in the
green sheer of her gown are very close to
Philip. Her smile flowers near him. She
whispers, and they turn away from me....</p>

<p>I open the door. The light from the room
tongues into the dark distance and is lost. I
look back. Mother and Doctor Stein are
chatting, she takes his cigarette and lights her
own from it. Father beside Mr. Fayn suggests
a play of the cards. Mildred and Philip
are side by side: her guitar lies at her feet.</p>

<p>—They have forgotten me?</p>

<p>I shut the door. I am in the black hall.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There is a blacker dark than that of the
starless night, there is a blacker dark than
that of the mountain. It is the black of this
hall. Those were a dark outside that my sense
invaded. This is a dark that is invading me,
that will fill me, choke me, if I stay in it long.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
It will drive out from the frail shell of my
mind any light.</p>

<p>Black hall, you must be gone through! I
press a finger underneath my brow, against
the lashes of my eye: I cannot see it. This
dark is immobile, so I must move. No gray
tinges it, no stir of light. It is packed density.
It fights against my knowledge that it is but
a hall ... a hall to be passed through, a hall
at whose other end as at the end I have entered,
is a door.</p>

<p>My will saves me from the sense that this
invading black is infinite. I make my hands
fumble along the walls: their path is a white
tracing that all my body joyously obeys. I
fumble at a door. It opens out. And the
compressed immensity of the hall blows me
into a room, blows the door shut....</p>

<p>There is one window, and the black of the
night pours in, gray. I face this window at
the room’s far end, and my eyes drink its grayness
with an uncanny thirst. This room seems
but a bellying out of the hall. At either side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
of me, blank walls. The room is long, for that
single window is far away, or it is very small.</p>

<p>At my side I grow aware of vibrance in
the dark: a vibrance near my shoulder, and
as tall as I. I force my head to turn. My
eyes see nothing. They rush back to the small
window whose gray they have drunk so
greedily. The window is gone! Was it a
window, then, whose light I have drunk with
my eyes? They turn again. Fear hurries with
pricking feet over my flesh. I want to go
back. The blackness of the hall would be balm
now to my eyes. For there is pillared vibrancy
beside me. Fright turns my flesh into
myriad scurrying feet. I turn to bolt. The
lock in the door snaps shut.</p>

<p>—I am alone: I am locked into this room
with that which locked me in.</p>

<p>The vibrance at my shoulder falls. And
my eyes descry a gradual human form picked
from the blackness. It is a subtle growing,
as if individual atoms of the dark were heightened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
there, grew gray, grew luminous, and
made a man.</p>

<p>He is looking at me, as the gray of his
form whitens. He is smiling at me. He moves
in the direction of the door, and I turn with
him to hold him in my eyes. He stands between
myself and the door he has locked.</p>

<p>His smile holds me. He is all grown, now.
I can see him. He is about as tall from the
ground as I. He is entirely white. Yet he
has features. He has hair, he has hands gently
clasped before him. I do not know what
power, colorless and faint, sharpens his body
to my sense. But even his smile is traced
upon me, and his eyes that seem to move
with a slow swinging up and down from my
brow to my feet.</p>

<p>And still he stands between me and the
door.</p>

<p>My fear is gone: it is all burned away in
the will to pass him, to pass the hall, to be
back in the lighted room. But even fearless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
how can I go when he stands between me and
the door he has locked?</p>

<p>“Let me pass!”</p>

<p>I have spoken, as my mind blanched at the
thought of a word. My voice is throaty and
real. His body grows a little dim at the words,
and tremors: he has heard. The tremor
steadies back into white.</p>

<p>His hand is beckoning me forward. His
smile grows more intense, works now in my
mind like a cold acid. But all my fear is
gone. I step forward. He has not moved.
I touch him.</p>

<p>What happens is an instantaneous act, and
has no mark upon my sense. It is I who am
next to the door: it is he, stands beyond, his
white form gray and subtly undulous.</p>

<p>I am all act. I have passed through the
bolted door. I lance the hall like a light. I
am once more in the lighted room.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>My loved ones have grown close since I left
them, smiling and saying that I would return.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
They are not aware that I am back. Mildred
and Philip murmur side by side. My father
has drawn a chair to the card-table and is
playing with Mr. Fayn. In the far corner
sit my mother and Doctor Stein, smiling, chatting.
I stand at the door and watch them.
All six faces are within my eyes obliquely, and
they do not see me.</p>

<p>Now instantly, these various faces turn:
see me: become one in a shrivel of horror.</p>

<p>I stand still. Their variance has rotted all
away. They are one.... Mildred and
mother and the others ... in a rigid gaze at
me, in a cold terror rising from their sight.</p>

<p>“Well, it is I: only I.” Their faces do not
move, they have not heard me.</p>

<p>But their stark death, making them one,
moves. They rise to their feet. Mildred and
Philip, faces fixed on me, retreat: Mr. Fayn
and my father move aside. They huddle together
in a single group. Six various bodies
crowded close and one, in a shrivel of horror.</p>

<p>I go forward. My hands are forward and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
I am near to them. They do not stir. With
my hand I touch the cheek of Mildred. With
my hand I touch the hand of my mother. My
hands go forward as through an impalpable
light! I sweep with maddened arms about
their bodies: my arms, unhindered, draw in on
themselves. They stand stark huddled, their
eyes fixed upon mine: and my arms thresh
through space!</p>

<p>Fear is full gathered in my throat. I shriek.
I shriek, and thresh with unresisted arms....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span></p>

<h3><i>b</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;AWOKE crying out.... Very warm,
close-bundled, I cry as with the toothless
hollow mouth of a babe. I cry and yet there
is no sound. I stop. I am more awake. My
opening eyes perceive a world that whirls in
mazing colors and threatens to break in. This
delirious dance subsides. I am quiet in my
bed and the dark air lies quiet all about me.
I know my body, I know my sheets and covers,
I know my room, my open window: the city,
purple and encaverned pours through the window
into my room. The room all this time
has slumbered quietly while I left it, and have
come back to it. Swift fears start still from
my muscles and my nerves, like discovered
stowaways of that journey whence I am back
in my room.</p>

<p>And then I knew my Dream, and my mind
was stripped of space and time as I tried to
face it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>—There is revelation in the Dream! Of
that I was convinced. Let me explore its
strangely shifting realm. But my mind could
not enter. There, stript for action, it pounded
at the gate, and it could not enter. I am
inside the revealing realm of my Dream. But
what good is that, since my mind cannot
enter?</p>

<p>I lie in this agony of confusion, holding
within my hand the key to the mystery that
has distraught my world: and surely my eyes
are good, yet when I strain to see, they veer,
they tangent off. I cannot see what I hold!</p>

<p>From this turmoil there must be release.
My body is moving. I do not know how long
I have lain in bed, breaking in vain at the
gate of my Dream. Not very long, for the
night is still there murmuring like a hollow
sea outside and sending in breakers at my
open window. There have been no other
thoughts, no fancies at all. The Dream is
palpable and I within it, and my mind that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
must rejoin me, knocking, beating. That is
all.</p>

<p>Then, sudden I am moving! I am getting
up, and calmly with the certainty of custom
I put on my clothes: I shut the house door:
I am in the street.</p>

<p>Faint vestige of dawn. In sparse gray filaments
dawn threads through the night: a
gradual loom of light that will thicken, that
will converge, that will become a texture....
On the street, at the door as I step out, is a
man.</p>

<p>He is waiting for me. He is clad in black,
he stands in the black shadow of the house:
all that emerges of him is his head which is
round and white.</p>

<p>All of his head is white: it has a plastic and
smooth pallor like the form of certain larvæ:
it is a color inhuman and yet deeply fertile.
He sees me and nods his head and I feel
the black-clad body stir in the gloom of my
house. I make no sign: I begin to walk.
At my rear I feel him walk apace with me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
He is behind and quiet, but he is leading me
by an invisible pressure which he holds upon
the nape of my neck, the cortex of my brain.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The city has that flaccid impenetrance which
comes before dawn. The rush of a car, the
pelt of horses’ hoofs, the stride of a man, the
flutter of a woman, quiver like darts against
the night and fall away. Night is this impenetrable
hide about the city.... We are outside
the city. A ferry-boat plethorically heaves
us across the River. I stand at the forward
rail, and the white head man, lost in a shadow
of drays and draymen and slowly stamping
horses, holds still his palpable pressure on my
brain.</p>

<p>—What if I turn about?</p>

<p>I look at the little waves ... the night is
windless ... thridding and skipping about
the hull of the boat. Their cool tips carry
dawn, between the night of the sky and the
night of the black waters.</p>

<p>—What if I leap in?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>Will the waves hold me? They will part,
treacherous and careless, and let me sink at
once to the night they dance against. I know
in an acceptance weary like age, that I can
not leap into the River, and that I cannot turn
about. I feel: this guiding pressure upon the
cortex of my brain, if it were in my eyes, that
it might blind me.</p>

<p>... We are walking in a field. This field
is very clear to me, as if its rugose stretch
and its barren saliences had already picked
their measure in my brain. The coarse grass
is dry and gray like autumn, on this sultry
April night. As my feet press through, the
grass rustles. The earth breaks into warty
mounds, grass tufted, and falls to sudden hollows
slakish with caked mud. I walk, and
though I have not seen his form save for that
moment at the door of my house, I know the
white head man following at my rear, and
leading, keeping pace with my feet so that the
sound of his steps is lost in mine.</p>

<p>The field is wide and long: no light of habitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
flecks its sallow gloom. But the rathe
filaments of dawn swirl in its air with more
abundance: a gray flush lies close to its black
furrows, catches in the grass and brings to it
a tremorous stir as if it was a mouth feebly
in voice. I walk. The field is wide and long.
The field’s horizons lip darkly down, making
this murmurous silence of the field a shut dank
thing, and I and the white head man imprisoned
in it.</p>

<p>He still prodding me on, prodding upon
the quick of my brain: he who is behind and
who is silent....</p>

<p>The ground looms a little ahead. And as
it rises, the dead grass ceases underneath my
feet. My feet tread sterile clay: they strike
on it hard as if the clay were frozen, and yet
the air of the field is wet and sultry.... My
feet stop.</p>

<p>I am at the top of the little loom of the
ground. Straight before me an empty shadow.
The ground cuts precipitous at my feet. It
wreathes about into a semicircle. Below me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
in the black lies a slakish gleam: a sort of
slime within the night: far below. And beyond
that, above this bottom of the circling
pit yet lower than the crest where I stand,
the field goes on over a clutter of broken rocks
and stone.</p>

<p>I have stopped short at the edge of a limekiln!
My feet have held firm!</p>

<p>There is rage in me.</p>

<p>“So this is where you led me? to my death?
to this ridiculous death? I, after Philip LaMotte,
after my mother and my father! My
death was to be at once more secret and more
horrible. No trace of me was to remain.
Well: come and push me in. It’ll take more
than the pressure of your eyes.”</p>

<p>My feet hold firm. The pressure on my
cortex fades with my rage, I step back a
little and dig a heel into the clay. Then I
turn about.</p>

<p>The man is closer than I knew: a little below,
for I am at the top of the field’s rise.</p>

<p>I stare at him and my rage makes a thrust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
from my eyes down to his beetling form. I
challenge him, silent. He is clearer now. I
can make out in the dawn the smooth black
cloth of his coat tight on his muscular body.
I can see well the blind and larval rondure of
his face.</p>

<p>My rage thrusts at him.</p>

<p>He rises from the ground.... “So this is
how you dealt your tall man’s blow at Philip
LaMotte?” ... and like a bird of prey he
planes low up toward me, over my head. I
whirl about and facing the kiln I see him slowly
plane into its slime.</p>

<p>His face remains free and his face is turned
toward me.</p>

<p>The silence is a texture of half-uttered
words: thick, the humid air and the shut field
and the kiln make for a silence bulging into
sound.</p>

<p>The white head is motionless above the kiln.
What I hear is his word. But the night speaks
it, the night’s silence is the word of this man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“Come down. The white one whom you
met in the other room ... he is here. Come
down. Join him. For it is he you seek, if
you are in earnest in your seeking. Come
down. You can’t quite see him: your eyes
are too gross. I am all of him that you can
see. But he’s here. Come down: and join
him. Do not touch him again. What good
is there in touching? Come down and join the
white one who is you, in the other room....
Here, if you will but come, you and he are
one. And I will be released. For I live in
the edge, the jagged, cutting edge of the difference
between you. And I am weary with
your biddings, I have done them well, I am
weary. Come down. And I will be released.”</p>

<p>My eyes go down into the kiln below my
feet, to meet the eyes of the man. My knees
hurt with a sudden strain. It grows. With
the tendons and muscles of my body I am
resisting the pull of the man inside the kiln.</p>

<p>There he floats, immersed save his head:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
and his smooth face shining at me ... pulling,
pulling.</p>

<p>The grip of my will upon my muscles
weakens. I hunch a little looking down from
the height. The man is smiling at me now.
It is as if he reads this hunch of my body
down toward him as the first step of my defeat.
He smiles. The strain of my legs shoots
upward to my back. Pain. The round head
in the kiln beckons in a horrid caricature of
bidding. I am growing weak. Anguish. My
knees are bent. My neck is forward and my
arms thrust out. Torture racks my body: my
muscles are corrupted. They press and shriek
to tumble in the kiln. My will and my mind
fight naked on the other side ... stript of
strength, stript of body ... to defend me
against the pull of the man within the kiln.</p>

<p>I am at the end. All of my body urges
down and forward. The muscles of my back
no longer hurt: they are numb, they are sheer
urgency to leap. Pain lives now only in my
forehead: my body is dead as if already it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
had joined the man in the slime of death. But
my brow holds back. It is a flame of resistance:
it is molten pain, knowing that it must
fight, knowing it must be shrewd to cheat my
body of its enamoured death.</p>

<p>My body is about to plunge within the kiln.
My body is a single clamor to be done. The
smile of the white head is a bland broad smile.
The head thrusts back, beckoning, ghastly at
ease.</p>

<p>My body is about to plunge into the kiln.
My mind is very shrewd at this threshold of
death. Beyond the kiln, the field goes on upon
a lower plane, over the clutter of broken rocks
and stone. In an ecstatic moment, as my legs
flex to leap, my will possesses them.</p>

<p>I leap. My body in that instant is the essence
of my will. I leap high. I leap far.
Not the kiln, the rocks beyond the kiln are
in my eyes....</p>

<p>I have leaped over the kiln. My body
crumples on the rocks. I embrace their harshness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
with caressing hands: my lips tear, grateful,
on their sharpness. This fierce pain in
my ankle, twisted as it struck, is sweet to me.</p>

<p>I lift myself, and turn. The kiln is behind
me: and there is no one in it.</p>

<h3><i>a</i></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MORNING and Spring pour into
my room.—My room ... my
bed ... my self. I have slept
in my bed as usual, this is Spring. Bright
resilient Spring, you’re a red-cheeked girl
laughing into my room! Mysterious Spring,
for you are real! Marvel of that: this volute
swelling bloom within my window. How wide
do you go? How deep?...—At the ruddy
heart of Spring a spot gray and harsh. I lie
in bed and grow aware of myself as a canker
in the morning.—Can we both be real? This
carnival of light does not destroy the canker:
all gayety sets off a gray moment that is I.
Which then is the real I must dwell in, since I
know that I am not this Spring?...</p>

<p>—Why am I this gray thing, lying in the
Spring?</p>

<p>—What is the matter with me? Where have
I been?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>—Morning ... <i>John Mark</i>. Does the
name construct a world? Oh, there’s a larval
world of dream that no sun has scattered. But
what is a world of dream against May’s wooing?
Spring pearls over larval worlds of
dream with its iridescent dance. Yes, there
is that darkling realm: let the sun then spill
it over ... limekilns and autumnal grass and
murder, murdered by the Spring. But they
come in! Which now is the dream, which the
real? Spring, can’t you reach the canker?...
It protrudes, it invades. Murder ...
<i>John Mark</i>!</p>

<p>Under the hall door there will be the daily
paper. What balm do I seek of that, wanting
it now for my eyes? I lie in bed, I seek
a balm of denial.</p>

<p>—In the paper you will learn what is real
and what is dreamed. Go for your daily paper
and watch the dark dream die. It will say
“Clear and warm to-day,” and your window
says it. Spring there, sitting on your window-sill,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span> 
says what your paper will say. So Spring
is real. <i>What else will it say?</i></p>

<p>I draw my legs from the covers. Pain.
<i>Then that is true?</i> My hand in a search that
makes its moving to my ankle a deep rent
of some sleep in my mind, touches the swollen
flesh of a larval truth.</p>

<p>—That ankle and its pain: the limekiln
and the man with the white head: my parents:
Philip: Mildred! The low house on the mountain?
The other room? How should I know
what is true? Perhaps there is no falsity at
all. If all is true, will horror go away? Spring
tides into my room, <i>my ankle scorched against
the limekiln slant</i>. I am John Mark, <i>Philip
LaMotte is dead</i>. I love you, Mildred, <i>read
what the paper says about the death of your
parents</i>.... How many things can there be
true at once?</p>

<p>An instant I have lain quiet in my bed.
Three volute worlds spin from a spot of my
mind in threefold spaces, touching one another
only at myself. One world has a surface of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
shimmering sunny waves. One world is an
opaque clot colored like blood. One world
is pale, a white transparency, and at its heart
little filaments ultra-violet, fixed, while the
misty surface spins.</p>

<p>The instant is gone. Painfully with my
swollen ankle, I make a way from the bed to
where, under the door of the living room, I
see the tip of the paper. I knew then how
I had marched that night through the bleak
field, away from the limekiln which lived in it
like a sultry evil eye: how I had reached a
suburb where the houses stood soiled between
the night and the day, and how a cab had
taken me home.</p>

<p>The black letters spoke to me:</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="indentright2">MR. AND MRS. CLAYTON MARK</span><br>
<span class="indentleft">DIE IN STRANGE MOTOR MISHAP</span></p>

<hr class="tiny">

<p class="center">L. I. Garage Man Held</p>

<hr class="tiny">

<p class="center">Well-Known Society Leaders Crushed to Death<br>
as Front Wheel Flies Off</p>

<hr class="tiny">

<p class="center">Only Son is Dr. John Mark of Institute</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>Well, John Mark, here is fact, whatever
truth lie under.</p>

<p>Mother and father are dead. You’ll no
more see them. They are bodies arrogantly
aloof from your erectness, from the touch of
your longing. The white head man who said:
“I am your slave” ... that’s a fact, too ...
doomed the car that slew your mother and
your father. You possess half a million ...
a fact! ... and you love Mildred, you can
marry Mildred. Is that the truth? Philip
LaMotte is dead. The white head man who
said: “I am your slave,” rose ... you saw
how he rises ... rose above Philip LaMotte
and with your surgeon’s science struck him
dead. Philip LaMotte dead, your mother and
your father dead: —I can marry Mildred?</p>

<p>... “A little truth. For God’s sake, now,
a little truth to season all these facts. Else
they’ll stink in your flesh, John Mark: they’ll
rot your soul, John Mark. A little truth.”</p>

<p>How strange that I lie bearably in bed!
Pleasantly. That ankle is a blessing. No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
fracture. I diagnose a strain and a bruise.
A fortnight’s rest will doctor it as well as any
doctor. A fortnight’s meditation will doctor
my mind and my soul. For they are sore
in need of healing. —Truth, to ease the chaos
of these maddening facts: truth that is harmony
like this which holds my body, all of its
stress and thrust, to the balance of health!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But first there is the funeral to go to.</p>

<p>The ankle’s an excuse to free you of that.
No: be borne in your royal litter, wounded
but heir to half a million dollars: borne to the
laying away of your slain parents. That is a
privilege too rarely human to be missed by
you. Such a son, such loving parents: and the
muffled friends, looking with veiled envy at
your devotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span></p>

<h3><i>b</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE day of the funeral was a bright
laughter. Sun sent its golden peals
across the sky that warmed and opened like
a wanton girl. The stones of the city as we
passed were a half liquid substance, laved and
entered and absorbed by the May morning.
Asphalt, men and women drab-clothed walking,
the strew of wagons and the loom of
houses ... all was a texture of imprisoned
light. I felt how all this various matter was
a whirl, crystallized and bound, of luminous
electrons: how all of it was one with the sun’s
steep pour and with the sudden jet of my own
mind merging with it.</p>

<p>The cemetery was a smile of lawn in which
the monuments stood like polished teeth. All
of the countryside was a response in laughter
to the frolicsome couple of the sun and sky.</p>

<p>We stood beside the Minister. The marble
vault opened its bronze grille and as the coffins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
slid into their place, a Christian word
nodded the act to gayety. Were not the coffins
polished? Was not the vault a little elegant
smile echoing the brash laughter of the skies?
And the solemnity of the group who with bared
heads watched the bodies of my parents slide
away, was it not thrust across the wanton mood
of the morning like a comic strip? Eyes dwelt
a moment upon me and read there the conventional
bereavement. A subtle counterpoint
stirred underneath the elemental laughter.
All of us seemed little whirls of dust modeled
by a momentary wind: pompously we were
acting our droll scene for the gods whose
straighter moods shone in the sun and the
earth, and who used us for their more intricate
and secret humors.</p>

<p>I have lost my mother and my father. How,
here, in this laughing farce of Spring, can
I dwell with my sorrow? Here all of us are
dwarfed too cruelly. Almost, I expected as
we walked away, to see the Minister fling off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
his mask and motley, to see the mourners caper
in relief as at a curtain’s drop: see all of us
and the dead bodies of my parents, too, and
their so polished coffins, take on the ease of
supers when the show is done: pocket their
pay and pass....</p>

<p>From the east, a cloud, swollen and purple,
voyages upon the sun. The earth shudders
as the sun is shut out, and like a festooned
ship upon a mournful sea it founders. Moving
toward home, I move in a dark element,
and it has swallowed all the laughing world.
This lawn is a breast of decomposing flesh.
The stones of the city are death substantiate,
feeding upon the drab-clothed men and women
who weave within and without in wistful
struggle to escape. Upon my window-sill
where Spring sat and pelted me with flowers,
an empty breath breathes emptiness.... The
true stuff of space in which our cosmos flickers
like a fly in a night of storm?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>I am on my couch.</p>

<p>—Oh, there must be a truth to salvage me
from chaos. Life is a whirlwind? Let the
Lord which is Truth speak to me then from
His whirlwind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span></p>

<h3><i>c</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THREE weeks I lie on my couch and am
alone. Three weeks of travail and unceasing
night. And at the three weeks’ end,
an infant birth of truth so frail and so nostalgic
of its womb that it scarce wills to breathe, and
every hour I must nurse it forward lest it
lapse back into the sweet Abyss.</p>

<p>The travail has its own life. When it is
done, there is the babe of a truth. And yet
how are they joined, this deep volumnear anguish
and this green sprout rising after? My
travail is an earth: and from its dark and
secret brood springs a light shoot of knowing....</p>

<p>I am in labor of my vision. I lie locked
in a distress spherical, moveless. My room
moves through time, time filters into it, so
I can mark the days. But time does not live
in this passionate whirling Sphere that is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
immobile body of my meditation. Or if time,
not thrice seven days but all the years of my
life and all the ages of my roots ere I lived.
All the pain of my years and their joys were
this great coil about me: were the bedded soil
of my distress. And all my loves and dreams
lived in it like the solved minerals in earth.
But this spheric stuff about me is not my love
nor my hate, not memory nor dream, not pain
nor joy: is all of these and mysteriously
more....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I am a child in my mother’s arms, and I am
grown and from my lips harsh words berate
this passionate woman who is my mother and
who has withdrawn from life, finding it in her
pride too painful to be borne. I am a boy
striding with awkward steps beside the magnificence
of my father, and at school facing
alone a crisis where he has failed to follow
... too selfish, too dry to share in my emotion.
Thoughts in serried troops invest my
mind, and I live and sleep in a clamor of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
science, philosophy and dream. Fragments
of verse tinkle in the stream of studious hours:
bones of dissected bodies and sprays of Spring
float together down my youthful way. I am
a lover, bringing to the bed of my beloved
nosegays of books and notes. Words rise like
birds from the margin of my mind, and blacken
the sky and scream and sink again, suddenly
become the stones of an exploded city crashing
to the ground. Here is a bower redolent
of dusk: my hands clasp the waist of a girl
and touch her breast. And in the limpid
shadow of the trees, there is a grave and I
must enter it, and study bones: and count
the countless cells that a girl’s breast has moved
to ecstasy within me. I sit with a story book
in the old house and watch my father rustle
the evening paper while my mother plays
languorous music at the piano. My own hand
rises menacing from my little body: grows:
grows immense: crushes father and mother:
shatters the walls of our house. I walk upon
a field that glitters underneath a scarlet sky.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
Sudden my beloved parents and the field and
all the things of earth, and all the things that
live, lift into sound!</p>

<p>The Universe was music! Pulsant, polyphonous
and vast, it slept like the western
plain, it rose like the mountains, it tided like
the sea, it sang like the stars. My heart was
music. Life swelled in myriad atoms, and
every one a separate song, and all one voice,
rounding, embodying me....</p>

<p>But once more there is time and I am moving
within it. Once more there is this shut,
expanding phase which men call life, and I
am bounded by it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Some fatal signal of my will has challenged
Truth to let me glimpse it, to let me <i>use</i> it:
and we are joined forever. If I am to live,
I must destroy this sin of using Truth for my
own life: I must make my life into a facet
of the Truth. Men have done that. (But
far more men have died.) Oh, let me make
my human life this glory! In its shallow close,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
the air will gleam with a transcendent fire: all
these broken surfaces of being which men call
bodies, things, will throb with the divinity of
wholeness. The common deed of spheres beyond
man’s flat domain is Miracle. And it
must enter now into my life. Or else I must
pass out.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I lie upon my couch and am lifted to the
topmost peak of a mountain solitude. In vaporous
essence, all the events of my mind and
of my heart rise from their recondite valleys
and are a cloud about me.</p>

<p>Solitude: at last I see your eyes. Deep
and inscrutable and without color they look
at me and draw my marrow. Solitude, you
are terrible because you are so full of my own
being. No other thing is there to impede
this flow of all my thoughts and all my passions
into your ghoulish void. Solitude, you are a
horror because you are my self. And this
... my self ... the air that I must breathe:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
and this ... my self ... the flesh that I
must eat.</p>

<p>Why has this been my fate? Have I not
loved my mother and my father? How differed
my childhood from another’s? Turmoil
there is always, moments of pain, flashes of
anger, little understreams of injury and resentment.
I was ambitious. Even as a child,
I felt that I must prevail upon the world.
And I was scarce a boy, when I knew my instrument,
and moved forth to fashion it; knowing
that I must create it, ere I could wield it.
<i>To prevail by the truth.</i> Was that a sin?
Who taught that that was sin? You are at
fault, if that is sin ... all you masters! You
Greeks and Hebrews, you noblemen of the
mind whose past words are the body of our
world. Why did you mislead me, if it is sin
for a young boy to say: “I will to live to
learn, as a man may, the truth.” ... But
perhaps you also, even as now I ... found
at the end of your passage, Hell. Perhaps
too late. Perhaps the gate of agony had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
clamped you in, before you could send back
to us a warning.</p>

<p>The world that I have lost was sweet.
Fondly I believed in it, devoutly I was attached
to my belief. The world is not well
lost. But it is lost indeed. How can I doubt
that? I have slain and buried more than my
father and my mother. My friends, how can
I meet them? And my work: and the glow
that came from work with colleagues and with
masters and that was great part of my delight
in work! And all my hopes ... the
memory of comrades and of loves that was
so good a promise of loves I might yet
win....</p>

<p>No more may I walk down the casual street
and watch with open eyes the open faces of
my brothers. No more may I let my sense
move close, sure in its right, to the woman who
calls it forth. No more may I be one of a
group at table, accepting easefully their acceptance.</p>

<p>O warm packed common of the life of man!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
the pleasant word with the waiter taking my
order; the humid confidence of the charwoman
who cleans my rooms; the nod to the policeman
at the corner; the gossip with the newsman,
a dark fellow with eyes great in dark
glasses; the community with crowds that I
won of my daily paper ... thrilling with
clerk and laborer at the latest scandal, shouting
at the portentous choice in the election
of Tweedledee over his rival Tweedledum; the
massed brotherhood at the Polo Grounds,
cheering the Giants, booing the Pirates ...
the intricate unsung sacrament of moving in
a family of men! All of us eat, all of us
know what hunger is and love, and sleep, and
sleeplessness. All of us have mouths that
give forth words, have ears that receive them.
Do we not walk in ecstasy so vast none can
give thought to it? None, save me, who am
barred. Not you, prisoner at Sing Sing. You
have comrades. Though they thrust you in
solitary, a whole world knows of you, either to
pity or to blame ... and both are ways of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
human intercourse. Not you, dead body rotting
in the earth, for you rot with your
brothers, you rot with all mankind. I am
alone. And there is no fellow to myself in
all the anguished and warm spaces of men!
Oh, I could sing a pæan to the life of the slave-galleys,
since there are fellow-oarsmen, since
there is a master. I envy the soldier driven
to his death. What warmth in the fellow fate
of his brothers, in the intense caress of the
enemy who slays him. Yes, the victim falling
from a blow knows the passionate caress of his
assailant. And the babe unborn presses its
blind hands against a womb that loves it....</p>

<p>Common street of the hospitable city. If
it be cold, what one of you who walk cannot
say “It is cold” and have response? If you
hunger, cannot you take your place in the
immemorial army of famine and despair, side
by side with all the others who know you,
who accept you, who salute your right to share
in the common want? Oh, if I could undo
any tragic search for the Truth that has slain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
me, that has made me lone as no star in the
crowded heavens ... how I would sing your
riches, manifold Life: Life, in whom men and
women move, signaling one another, touching
bodies, sharing pain and laughter! Oh, fool
to seek the solitary Truth, when Ignorance is
crowded and is warm.</p>

<p>I am alone. Has hope, the latest straggler,
that remains even when anguish has departed,
whispering: “Peace ... you will die.” ...
has hope gone, too?</p>

<p>The faces of mankind are stranger to me.
And the city where I live is a cold memory
that has forgotten how to greet me. And
my work that loved me is a lie too small to
hold me. Has hope gone, too?</p>

<p>—You are a sufferer who can say to no
one: “I suffer.” You are a sinner and there
is no name for your sin. You are too lone
to confess: too lone even to be despised....
<i>But the word hope must still be there, since
you recall it?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>God stands so far away: the truth, that
God is All and that no life can die, is not a
neighbor. Truth sweeps away the nearness
of good things. For the things good unto
the life of man are they on the bright surface
where man crawls: it is the brightness of his
need that makes them shine. Blesséd,
blesséd man! Fool, when you seek the truth
that lies in darkness. Sage when you stone
your sages, when you crucify your Christs.</p>

<p>God is too far, and too vast.</p>

<p>But the word hope is there!</p>

<p>Hope ... Mildred ... there?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>So came the thought of Mildred, and grew,
thriving on hope, hope on her, until the two
were one and at last were all. The world
were well lost indeed, if Mildred still could
be my world. If, knowing what I was, what
I had done, how tragically I had been moved
to equal her own ruthless, wordless wisdom—if
she accepted me, I could accept the truth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
and master it, and bring it down to our own
livable world. What sin was mine, if Mildred
still was mine? What loss if all my
loss had purchased her? I was no sickly repentant
to bewail that my will had forged
from the Whirlwind weapons to make its way.
I was not weeping because Philip LaMotte
lay dead, and my idle parents. No: I wept
because my act had slain my world and left
me all alone: I wept because of the falsity,
the ugliness, the sterility of what my will had
done. But if it had won Mildred, if it brought
to my life the beauty of Mildred, then indeed
my will was mastered by a greater and was
good.</p>

<p>Mildred and hope throve on each other so,
and grew in my mind: and my body healed.
I thought toward the day when she would
come at my call and we would consummate a
marriage whose like earth had not known.</p>

<p>—What waits on that day? I said at last.
Is there not a telephone in your room? And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
though I have used it little these three weeks,
have I not a voice?...</p>

<p>Her voice answered mine. And said that
she would come.</p>

<p>“<i>This afternoon.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span></p>

<h3><i>d</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;WALKED to the door, I opened for her.
In the day’s low light, I looked at her.
Mildred! the lovely body of my hope. A sharp
pang cut across my eyes: I would not question
it. I looked at her, moved all my power
to know upon her standing there within my
room, so free and so near.</p>

<p>The weeks had worn her. Her golden hair
strained back from the transparent, faintly
throbbing temples. The brow was higher,
more pale, with this new way she caught her
hair back, almost brusquely, from it. Her
body seemed lighter: it was a sheath ever more
frail and quick to the fluid of her soul. She
stood at ease, and yet a subtle drooping of
the shoulders, the clasp of the tapered fingers
on her breast, marked a fine tracing of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
time upon her. She was intact, but a rain of
circumstance had worn her.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Mildred,” I said.</p>

<p>She sat down, and watched me. The pang
across my eyes was sharper still. She arose
again: took off her cape and sitting folded
her hands in her lap.</p>

<p>“Mildred——”</p>

<p>What was the cause of this pang? Was
she a disappointment to my eyes, that what
they saw hurt knife-like? Oh, she is perfect
fair. And yet I know, even before I have
begun to speak, what is this knowledge pressing
and cutting my eyes, which all her fairness,
all my words unspoken shall not prevail
against.</p>

<p>“Mildred—Mildred.”</p>

<p>I felt the need of touching her, as if to
prove that she was there. I came to her and
I knelt at her side, and I took her hand ...
she let me take her hand ... and I pressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
its palm against my brow. The pang is sharp,
inside: her hand cannot reach it.</p>

<p>I arose. And my words came as earnestly
for me, as for herself.</p>

<p>“Mildred, you know that I love you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, John,” was her whisper.</p>

<p>“You are all my life. When I saw you
last, this was true and I knew it for true: and
I said this to you. But, Mildred, I could
not dream then how true it was, how true it
was going to be.”</p>

<p>Her eyes at once were darker and more
bright, filling with her sympathy. She was
thinking of my parents.</p>

<p>“Not alone that,” I said. “Not alone that.
Least of all that, dear Mildred. Everything
is gone. I have left the world. I have irrevocably
lost it. For a long time unknown to
myself, I was preparing this. Even when
last you saw me, and the time before ...
that last time at your house, when Philip died
... I was, unknown to my feeble consciousness,
slaying the world. And I am all alone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
And it is all well lost. Not that I did not love
it. But look, my darling, all of it I love, and
all in it I love, has become you!”</p>

<p>She accepted this as no new thing ... no
new wonder.</p>

<p>“You had become all in life that my life
needed. And the rest was a husk ... to be
cut ruthlessly out.”</p>

<p>She withdrew her hand from mine. She
clasped her hands in her lap and looked at
me in a gesture of peace so far from my turmoiled
state, that my eyes hurt, spanning the
abyss between us.</p>

<p>“All of this ... you must listen carefully,
for you must understand. That is my single
hope: that you will understand: and all that
I am saying is the truth, weighed as a man
of science weighs, beloved ... all of this was
taking place in me not from the moment when
I knew you, but long before. What the world
promised seemed good. Faith, passion, beauty,
joy, the comradeship of perfect understanding,
love in peace and in its strife ... all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
this ... the dangers faced with more bitterness
than hope, the hours when anger cleanses,
the quiet ways through woods, the ceremonials
of the sea, day ... night ... the secret
dwelling within the body of the belovéd as in
the heart of heaven: all this the world had to
give, and all this I cherished and believed in.
But of all this, the world as I knew it was
unworthy. Every jot of it was a crass imperfection
ironically giving birth to a dream.
Men and women were but maimed bits of
themselves. Passion and vision were shreds
torn and drooping, not banners across the
sky.</p>

<p>“So I withdrew from the world, Mildred,
the world’s splendor. That was before you
came. How wonderfully, though I did not
know, it was for your coming!”</p>

<p>I could not read her smile. And yet it
moved me, making me defensive not for me:
for her.</p>

<p>“I did not create for myself the image of
a woman, and when I met you like a romantic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
confound that image with my eye’s.
No, my withdrawal from the world of the
world’s splendor was more terrible than that.
For it was absolute. It was designless, and
ruthless. It was, because it had to be. The
world could not hold my desire of the world.
Let the world therefore go!” ...</p>

<p>“Dear,” I drew closer to her, “how could
I have dreamed that there would be a morrow
... the morning when I knew you ... by
whose light all that had gone, all that had been
dreamed, was darkness?”</p>

<p>What I had now to say no words of mine
seemed great enough to bring. I was kneeling
at her side. Again I took her hand ...
again she let me.</p>

<p>“Did I know deeply always that I would
know you? And the long years of vigil, of
abstinence, were they my need, a wiser than
the knowledge of my mind, to prepare my
house for you? I cannot say. I know too
well what infinite ways we go beyond the shallow
tracings of our mind, to doubt that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
might be. And yet, Mildred, the morning of
my finding you was bright only as could be
morning to a man who had dwelt in perpetual
Night, and who knew not there was such a
thing as sun. Can you picture him amazed,
seeing the unknown sun? seeing the crystal
radiance of dew, seeing a sky that is not black
and the young clouds about his head: seeing
last of all his lamp that had been his sun, fade
to a blot against the wide magnificence of
morning.”</p>

<p>I bent my head and pressed her hands
against my brow once more. So, with eyes
shut, I kneeled while the day dimmed, and
heard the steadfast lifting of her breath, and
felt her there, and knew not what I felt: so
sweet, so near, so unbearably far she was.</p>

<p>“Mildred,” I whispered, “what would this
man do, enamored of his morning, his first
morning ... what would he do, if there was
danger that the morning go, ere he had more
than glimpsed it?”</p>

<p>I raised my eyes slowly. She was looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
at me. Her eyes did not stir, meeting mine.
It was as if they had begun to see a thing
within me, and were rapt in that deep focus.</p>

<p>“Mildred,” I whispered, “all this that I
know and that I tell you now, I have known
only since last I saw you. My mind strove,
you know how purely, to make great my will.
It worked better, O terribly better than I
knew. For at the end, my will became so
masterful that it ceased to consult my mind.
How long it had been this masterful monstrous
thing, I cannot say. But when there was
danger that the dawning sun go or be clouded:
then it worked. And only after what anguish
of search, did I learn what it had done!”</p>

<p>She looked with her deep still gaze within
me. Upon her eyes a faint glaze gleamed and
it was hard, this surface of her eyes, hard and
defensive: not like her eyes at all. I talked
as if to pierce this glaze, as if to melt it.</p>

<p>“Perhaps from the beginning my will
worked and made a fool of my mind ... a
slave and a fool. Perhaps it was preparing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
from the first day, for you. Do you think
that could be? And all my labors in science
seeking the truth, all the chaste rigors of my
life ... do you think perhaps these were
blind ways for the working of my will ...
plotting for you, wanting to possess you?</p>

<p>“For when I saw you, I wanted to possess
you. And since I saw so deep, that was a sin.
The shallow man may dare to possess. But
your body was not enough for me: nor your
mind, nor your love. Oh, I wanted them!
But I beheld in you what no man can possess.
Your mysterious power—the wisdom
of your beauty which is so great that it has
no words, that it disdains your mind. I wanted
to possess that, above all. By equaling it—I
with my plodding mind of words and concepts!
I became mad in love of your beauty:
I wanted to possess, by equaling your beauty.</p>

<p>“Mildred, I must tell you everything. There
is a brutal strain in my will. And when the
end that it would win is brutal, it does not tell
my mind. For my mind is not brutal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>“Mildred, there were obstacles in the way
of my will to my life’s final need; obstacles
to you. For you must be mine perfectly.
Even my mind agreed in that, and suffered.”</p>

<p>Her hand was motionless in mine. It was
like a sleeping thing.</p>

<p>“I killed Philip LaMotte, who was in the
way of my will.”</p>

<p>Her eyes seemed to be drawing forward
from their distant focus to my mouth, as if
what they had seen before within was now
articulate there.</p>

<p>“My will killed the man whom my eyes had
never seen, whose name I did not know, nor
whose existence until you told me he was dead.
My mind knows that, now.”</p>

<p>I could not bear her hand, this dead thing
in my own. I could not let it go.</p>

<p>“There was another obstacle to our perfect
marriage. I was poor, Mildred ... and my
work was the sort men praise, the sort that
nourishes men, but that they do not pay for.
I went to see my parents, on that same fatal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
night when I was with you, and when my will
was slaying my one rival. I told my parents
of you: I begged them to give me money, so
that I might ask you to become my wife. They
refused. Mother, because she loved me selfishly
and did not wish me to marry. Father
because he loved only his ease.</p>

<p>“... I slew my parents.”</p>

<p>Then I could let loose her hand.</p>

<p>With her other hand she clasped the hand
I had held. She felt it: she shuddered. She
let it drop to her side.</p>

<p>“My will did away with my parents. I am
their heir. I am rich.”</p>

<p>Again she clasped the hand which I had
clasped.</p>

<p>“There was a deeper reason for my deeds—a
better reason. My will, in these ruthless
acts, proved itself equal to the power of your
beauty: equal to the power in you which had
called forth my love. These were sacrifices
to you, Mildred: to the Goddess within you!
Sacrifices to prove your lover as terrible, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
ineffable, as strong as was my love, and as
was the power in you that made me love you.”</p>

<p>Mildred arose. Her hands quavered up to
her brow.</p>

<p>“John ... are you mad!”</p>

<p>I smiled, and feared to smile lest the smile
be horrible to her. Her hands clasped her
brow. Then suddenly she let them fall. Her
face hardened an instant, a glaze of resolution
around its tender bloom. She sat down.</p>

<p>“John, can you explain what you have
said?”</p>

<p>She seemed wholly woman. Could it be
that my words diminished her? What I had to
say was unreal and strange, now she seemed
wholly human.</p>

<p>But I told her my story. And as I spoke,
slowly, with care, I bled with agony. For this
was fire I was pouring all about the flower
of my love. How would she emerge? Transfigured
to be my mate, wedded by fire to
fire? Or ash?</p>

<p>So I went on, and told my story....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>“Whence does he come, this larval man
whom my will summoned, whom my will endowed
with all the cunning of my learnéd
brain, to slay, perfectly, surely? Is he gone
forever? In that moment at the limekiln,
when my intelligence had challenged my will’s
deed and we stood locked in conflict ... the
larval creature of my will, and my self of the
light ... did I do him away? I think he is
gone forever. He could live only when my
mind slept: and now it is awake. That is why
he strove to murder me. To drag me by the
dark roots of us both into the boil of the limekiln.
And he failed. Had he not been desperate,
surely he would not have tried to kill
his master by whose darkness he lived. My
mind won in that electric moment! My mind
leaped with my body, to the other side. He
will lurk no more, murder no more. For my
soul knows him.... But he has seared my
soul.”</p>

<p>Her hands did not cease from moving while
I spoke. Now, in my silence, they moved.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
They clasped in anguish on her breast. They
went to her brow. They tremored at her side.
They were like flowers tremulous in a flame.
She sat, swaying gently, like an agéd woman.</p>

<p>I was silent. Her head turned, and she saw
me. The glaze in her eyes grew as what she
knew was measured with her sight. Her body
was rigid. Her pain was freezing her. She
swayed no more. And her hands were lifeless.</p>

<p>I knelt before her. But I did not dare to
touch her. I put forth my hands, but they
remained suspended. For I did not dare to
touch her.</p>

<p>“Mildred,” I said, “save me.”</p>

<p>She watched my hands, as if she wondered
what these suppliant palms were going to do.</p>

<p>“There is power in me, Mildred. And
power, if it is happy, is divine. Do you now
know how I have needed you? Have I not
won you? Save me!”</p>

<p>She watched my hands. They covered my
face an instant. I stood up. And I stood
over her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>“Mildred, I have been ruthless. Yes. More
ruthless than my mind would ever have conceived.
Is that a weakness in me? I loved my
parents. They were the only human beings
in my life. I was ruthless, because I was in
love with Beauty. I have used truth ... as
it was revealed to me, vastly beyond our miserable
sphere ... I have used truth, because
I was in love with Beauty.”</p>

<p>Her face was blanched as if some fire had
seared it. Her eyes were like stones. Her
beauty was a mask.</p>

<p>I feared what I saw in her, for it was the
worst of myself.</p>

<p>“We must go on, now, Mildred. We dare
not stop. You and I together with truth at
our command, to create Beauty. To make
Beauty live.... Mildred, will you save me?”</p>

<p>Still she did not speak. She watched me
from her place below me as I stood. But she
watched my eyes. And her eyes were limpid
again, and warm; their glaze had melted.</p>

<p>“I have learned that Truth is cold. It is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
cold that burns: terribly and relentless. Truth
cares not for man, and man in love with it is
like a moth who would possess the sun. Oh,
have I learned too late! Man cannot live with
Truth. And yet he loves it. So by a miracle,
he turns it into Beauty. And he dwells with
Beauty. Save me! Save me!”</p>

<p>Her face broke, and her hands covered it.
She wept.</p>

<p>“My love, my love,” I said, “do you not
understand? I want to be a man. And I have
glimpsed the terrible face of truth. That is
the curse of my will. Love, I want to be a
man again ... to live ... to live in your
love ... to live in Beauty. Save me!”</p>

<p>She wept silently. Little waves of anguish
welled with her breast, rose to her neck and
her arms.</p>

<p>She wept long. I knelt beside her. She
knew me there. I did not touch her, but she
knew me there. Would her weeping cease,
and would her hands come to mine?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>She lifted her head. She did not look at
me. She rose. I, kneeling, waited. Then, her
eyes came down.</p>

<p>I knew that I had lost her.</p>

<p>I understood the pang across my eyes when
first she came into the room: I knew that I
had known that she was lost.</p>

<p>She stood there before me kneeling: her
skirt touched my face. She was turned toward
the door, and her eyes were upon me.
They were far away.</p>

<p>I drank her beauty like an immortal wine
within a cup of death.</p>

<p>... O sweet beyond song is woman at her
Spring! You are life, you are the wrung essence
of all life. For you I have made myself
an ashen path through the splendor of gardens.
For you I have denied my soul all their flung
radiance. That I might drink you perfectly.
And I am all athirst. My ashen way has dried
my mouth, and opened my desire. I am all
thirst for you. And I have lost you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>—Mildred, will you see this longing in my
mouth, and go?</p>

<p>—Mildred, will you see this death in my
eyes, and go?...</p>

<p>—You have gone already. And I am alone.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span><i>I have told my story. And, reader, though
it has no moral, and though it may have
brought you more bewilderment than joy, it
has served its primary purpose. It has enabled
me once more to live among you. Take the
most anguished page, the blackest with my despair;
it has been joy for me to write that page,
for in the writing I relived it. And where I
am, even the darkest human hour in memory
is bright. If I suffered, it was because I still
could strive: if I despaired it was because I
still knew hope. Such are the jewels of man’s
world. For man’s world is a playground
whither the drab cosmic angels come for holiday.
Strife, pain, suspense, anguish of heart
and flesh, sacrifice and crime ... these are
the raiments of Love. These are the joyous
motley of the angels when they make feast
on earth.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span><i>... I see an evening earlier in my life. I
had just returned from my exhilarant years in
Europe. It was June, and I was staying with
a friend who lived with his wife in the Berkshire
Hills of New England. They had been
called to a nearby town: I declined their invitation
to go along with them. I supped alone
in their house. There was cheese redolent of
meadows and manure; there was honey that
smelt of clover; there were vegetables lightly
cooked so that the resilient air of April and
of May still lingered in their green.</i></p>

<p><i>I sat on the porch alone, smoking my pipe,
and watched the sun fall through the scattered
hedge of fir trees and dogwood, copper-beech
and locust. The air was alive with the
acacia scent and with the song of birds. Their
voices swarmed the leafage: oriole and grackle,
virio, thrush and thrasher. Impudent red-breasts
marched across the green: a catbird
with its stridence set in tune the melodious
symphony of the sweeter birds.</i></p>

<p><i>The evening was alive. From the cropped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
grass of the lawn, the trees rose sheer: the
trunks were columns of the earth; the
branches, whelmed by leaf and shadow, made
a firmament beneath the sky. I sat and was
happy in this singing dusk. The shadows and
the dying sun, the pied shrill chatter of the
birds, came to me as a single happiness, ripe
for my mood.</i></p>

<p><i>And then, in a flash, the veil had lifted, and
I saw.</i></p>

<p><i>This lovely scene that soothed my weariness
and made me happy, bringing to my lips soft
sentimental phrases, was a shambles! In a
spruce that bowered from my porch, I watched
a brown thrasher wheel and screech about a
branch in which an owl, ensconced, brooded
over its young. The little bird was delirious
with fear. It threshed its wings and screamed:
it pecked at the robber owl and flew away. It
wheeled, screamed up its courage, shot in and
pecked again. Robins were devouring worms.
A handsome woodpecker massacred wood-slugs
on the boll of a beech. No single creature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
in that gentle dusk, but was engaged
in bitter desperate war. And I sat, idle, burning
my tobacco, slaying the mosquito that
dared to buzz within the reach of my majesty....
All the world was murdering or murdered.
Was it less fair for that?</i></p>

<p><i>My time was to come. And I, like these
humbler creatures of the lawn, knew my hours
of crisis, knew the heartbreak of desire, the
black shrouds of failure. Was my time less
fair for that?</i></p>

<p><i>O reader, if you must glean a moral from
my story, let it be this! I lean back over the
Precipice of Time, and greedily relive those
hours which you call hours of anguish: relive
those days of failure, since they were living
days. Was it not then that my heart beat
highest, that passion coursed most free, that I
was most alive?</i></p>

<p><i>Out of the ash that you call history, rises
the eternal flame of Love. Warm yourselves
there, my brothers and my sisters. For the
time will come when you will watch Love’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
distant gleam, desperate and nostalgic like a
winter moth which beats on the frosted window
trying to get in where the light burns,
which beats and beats until it falls emaciate in
the snow....</i></p>
